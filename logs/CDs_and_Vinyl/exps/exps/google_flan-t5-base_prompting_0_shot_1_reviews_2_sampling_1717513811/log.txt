They Want My Soul Baby Blue | Such a great return to form, Transference was an ultimately forgettable album to me, and this is still rocking my iPod a year after release. Vinyl mix is great a dead quiet surface noise. Love these guys and love this album.

Oh so cool in mono!

The item description is Rubber Soul. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Remastered from the analog tapes the sound of these mono reissues is just stunning and the quality of the vinyl pressing is beyond reproach.  The freshness of the songs and sound is amazing for being originally released 50 years ago in December of 1965.  The soundstage of these mono recordings are amazing and countless times I swear I hear vocals or specific instruments from one side of the room or the other, not the speaker itself.  Mono is how the Beatles intended these to be heard (stereo was still a bit of a gimmick at this point) and this mix does not disappoint.

I was so excited to get this afternoon. It said it was original sountrack, but it only instrumental. Music was nice but I thought there would lyrics or is it defective? I I I tried on two different cd's.

American Saturday Night | I like the music for it is complete with the total fulfillment of instrumentation. Brad has the voice for the songs which is nice. His understanding of total music through hispast training makes his CD better than many just because listening to the music without the vocal would be just fine at times.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Martina Mcbride has an absolutely beatuful voice--as she shows on "Over the Rainbow." Unfortunately, however, the majority of the songs that she chose for "Martina" are way too shmalzy for my taste. I much prefer some of her earlier releases like "The Way That I Am."

The item description is Martina. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: She has a wonderful voice, but the music lacks intensity for the background of the songs. She is a favorite female vocal but we wish it had music that would lift your experiance through the background musicians.

This is one of those movies that is great for people of all ages. The soundtrack is great (obviously, it's The Beatles).

The item description is He !. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: As a person who's about the same age as the Beatles, I was an enthusiastic fan at that time.  I still like to listen to their music occasionally.  This movie was a trip when it was released.  That's because everyone in the world was hungry for anything the Beatles put out.  Forty years later, it's just plain dumb.  I tried sitting through this thing with my 11, 12, & 14 year old grandkids, but even they couldn't stomach it.

Hysteria | So many hits on this album. One of their best. This was made after the drummers accident that severed his arm. Did that stop him. Hell no. He came back after recovery, got back into the swing of things, literally, and to this day is a pretty good drummer if I may say so myself. 5 stars. Go Rick Allen

I saw this album staring at me every time I went into a certain record store in a small mall near where I lived in 1968. Something about the five part photo-montage of the groups members intrigued me. No one did any trick photography/art on their album covers between 1966 and 1990 unless the group had something to offer that was exceptional. This happened with Angel's "Helluva Band" album, "Revolver" and "We're Only In It For The Money" and "Absolutely Free" and many, many other albums. While this wasn't as trick as THOSE boys, something told me to take a chance on it.A very pleasant surprise! The first cut, "Fresh Garbage", is immediately likeable for its great bass and guitar work, drums and keyboards, and is probably ...

The item description is Wake of the Flood. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Wake of The Flood (WOTF) is, IMHO, the single best studio Dead<br />recording. ...  If you<br />don't like the Dead (...), you won't like WOTF. If you like<br />the Dead, you must own this disk.  First of all, it contains Weather<br />Report Suite -- one of the Dead's very finest pieces ever.  Secondly,<br />everything else on the album is great too. Check out Stella Blue:<br />slow? yes -- and soul shakingly sublime.  Check out Eyes of the World<br />-- A classic Dead jam piece.  You should also check out other Dead<br />albums Blues For Allah, Terrapin Station, and From The Mars Hotel.<br />These are not &quot;pop&quot; records.  You will have to listen to<br />them carefully and learn them.  But your efforts will be repaid 1000<br />times over.  Enjoy!

Check Your Head Explicit Lyrics | Lyrically, they're coming more from the heart here, not just imitating others.Musically, they're at their best. &quot;Pass the Mic&quot; is particularly awesome. &quot;Something's Got To Give&quot; is a classic piece of music. They continue to use samples to enhance their own funky grooves, brilliantly.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I had not heard this for awhile when I popped it in the player the other day. Wow, to this day it evokes strong feelings in me. An all out musical and lyrical assualt. This is truly the first classic XTC effort. Only one weak song in the entire effort (the disposable &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;) this one is hard to top, although as you know they were able to.

The item description is Black Sea. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: The record's not perfect.  The band complained afterwards that the producer (Steve Lillywhite) seemed preoccupied with other projects and wasn't putting enough energy into this record.  Indeed, the record's sound is somewhat flat and the songs are allowed to go on for too long in some cases (some shorter arrangements are needed - which is the first priority of any record producer, tight arrangements.  Presumably Lillywhite got sick and tired of arguing with the band and just dumped what they had onto tape).<br />But the material is largely great - XTC hitting their stride.  &quot;Paper and Iron&quot;, &quot;Respectable Street&quot;, &quot;Travels in Nihilon&quot;, &quot;Towers of London&quot;, &quot;Living Through Another Cuba&quot;, &quot;Generals and Majors&quot;, &quot;Burning With Optimism's Flames&quot; ... these are great songs.  And the band's playing is solid.<br />Plus you have to love a record with a one-note &quot;bouncing ball&quot; guitar solo in one song (&quot;Love at First Sight&quot;).<br />So, I think they're right to complain about Lillywhite's cut-and-run job on their work, but even without as much ear candy as later producers were able to work into their music, this is still an album you'll want to hear.  The bonus tracks are pretty good too - &quot;Somnambulist&quot; is a moody minimalist piece that still sounds good, and &quot;Don't Lose Your Temper&quot; is one of the best up-tempo numbers they ever cut.

Output: review: 'Something's Got To Give' is a classic piece of music. They continue to use samples to enhance their own funky grooves, brilliantly.

Rebelutionary | This is a nice album with a lot of substance, a lot of meaning, and a lot of relevance. On the other hand, I am not a fan of that revolution business as nothing will be changed, nor do the majority of the hip hop population is phased by it. Despite that fact, the production is solely handled by Numonics, producing a steady stream of jazzy and soulful beats over uninspired drum loops. The beats are more than adequate to push the album forward and has a cohesive feel as a similar signature is noticeable betweem the beats. Reks performs well, with his usual continuous flow and deep lyrics accompanied by aggressive choruses. His flow is continuous but on point as he rides the beats nicely. Although ...

This the best duo since Outkast. The beats are thumping which is unusual for rappers on the higher tier lyrically.You will be half way through a song thinking Godemis killed it, then Ubi comes on and nukes the track. The whole album goes like that. Lyrically these two are playing catch with a wrecking ball.

Target: PRODUCTION: 5/8<br />LYRICS: 7/8<br />CONTENT: 4/8<br />ENJOYMENT: 5/8<br /><br />Lyrically impressive release that lacks depth and memorability.<br /><br />PROS<br />- very nice and on point quick-tongued flow<br />- reminds me of such duos as Camp Lo & M.O.P.; similar strength & styles but distinguishable<br />- lyrically strong and complex<br /><br />CONS<br />- a heavy bit of fillers; album's a little long<br />- production does not stand out<br />- lacks depth

"Take That to The Bank," "Second Time Around," "Right in The Socket," "Make That Move," "Night to Remember," "Dancing in The Sheets," "This Is for The Lover in You," are ABSOLUTE ESSENTIALS, and not just for the Shalamar fan, but for any fan of great, smooth, r&b and dance from the period. The songs are catchy, the production flawless [featuring full orchestration mostly and great playing throughout], and the vocals of Howard Hewitt and Jody Watley are very distinctive. Wow! 7 of 13 are essentials. I wouldn't settle for anything less than the full-length versions, and enjoy the extended versions, as well.

The item description is Shalamar: The Collection. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I cannot say enough about how beautiful the lyrics and upbeat this music is... I was lucky enough to see the original group in concert in Fort Lauderdale in the 1980's and they had me and many people standing up, clapping and singing to their GREAT MUSIC!  As a former DJ, I must recommend this highly, if you enjoyed the dance era of the late 70's and the 80's.  Shalamar is a class act!

What an amazing concert this is! I am really surprised by some of the reviews that have been written. It's an excellent production and the sound quality is fine. This concert is a gem, Christopher Cross at his best. Christopher and the other musicians did a fabulous job performing these songs to the high quality standards of the original recordings. They did an incredible job. Christopher's guitar work will leave you spellbound. He's is truly one of the all time great guitarists... you'd never realize that because he's branded as adult contemporary but he really know how to rock on electric guitar yet also is a talented acoustic performer. His performance on "Words of Wisdom" took my breath away. The real treat is to hear the music ...

Daredevil: The Album | I have to say that I bought this album for the tracks from Fuel, Saliva, Seether, Rob Zombie, etc. You won't be disappointed if you buy the album for these groups but that's not the best part of the album. I bought the album for the rock songs and in fact never even listened to Evenescence. Then I saw the movie this weekend (twice, actually). And what I remembered was the song that played at Elektra's father's funeral (My Immortal). I couldn't get it out of my head. Simply one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. It couldn't have fit the scene any better. Amy Lee's voice is unbelievable. I'm eagerly awaiting their debut album and its 3/4 release. This is coming from a ...

I use to pay $40 for live music bootleg CDs as a youth in the early 90's. But thanks to Pearl Jam's innovative effort to release all their concerts as live CDs for a regular price; today paying a sale price of $25 or so for an excellent PJ Bootleg may seem on the high side. But the LIVE Boston "bootleg" CD from April 12, 1994 is worth every penny if you buy this 3 disc Deluxe Edition package just for it.The Remastered Vs. and Vitalogy CDs (w/ bonus tracks) sound even better than their originals, except I like the original version of "whipping" better. vs. bonus track "hold on" (demo) is an acoustic gem w/ just voice and guitar. If your old CDs are scratched, or ...

The item description is vs. & Vitalogy Featuring Live At The Orpheum, Boston MA. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I agree with all the points of the other good reviews to this set.  I would add that the extra songs are well worth it.  Corduroy is one of my favorite songs and the alternate version, while quite similiar to the original, is different enough to make it worth the money alone.  I also like the other versions of Nothingman & Betterman.  The McCready stomp is good as well.<br /><br />The live album is very good as well.  I have probably 10-15 live albums from the last 10 years and a couple bootlegs from earlier.  I don't think any of them had "Rats" on it which this one does.  I love that song and the live version is great.  The best part of the live album is the group still had the anger/passion in their songs since this was from 1994.
