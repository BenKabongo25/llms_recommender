Physical Graffiti | CD in great shape.
Best Of | There is a scratch and it affects the 7th or 8th track.
Can't Buy A Thrill | It came to my address quickly and it sounds great and was packaged well. It was also priced right. Satisfied!

OK, all right, I wrote off Collective Soul after &quot;Shine&quot;, figuring I'd never hear from them again. The fluke hit &quot;Gel&quot; (let's face it, any hit song from the Jerky Boys movie is automatically a fluke) was goofy fun, but didn't exactly leave me howling for more. But this album is a very good listen from a band I frankly didn't expect much from. Mixing good hard songs (&quot;Smashing Young Man&quot;, &quot;She Gathers Rain&quot;, &quot;Gel&quot;) with good soft songs (&quot;When the Water Falls&quot;, &quot;The World I Know&quot;, &quot;December&quot;) makes for a pretty good listen from start to finish. A few of the songs don't make much impression on me, and they do seem to have only two modes of play (hard and soft), but they keep things ...
Obviously the CD sounds much better than the tape cassette ever did. Why did I wait 20 years to get their CD? Collective Soul is a group of excellent musicians creating beautiful, groovy music where each song is unique. The vocals and perhaps their instruments' tuning is the only way to recognize songs previously unheard as Collective Soul- I mean, the music they played ranged from slow and soft ballads to faster paced rock, some with digital/electronic elements. All melodic with some heart and a whole lot of SOUL!
I judge an album's worth by how much I want to grab my guitar and learn its songs. The first time I heard COLLECTIVE SOUL, with its first cut, "Simple," I was dusting off my old Fender, plugging in, and jamming away. "Simple" is definitive, hard-driving rock 'n roll, the kind of sound that gets the blood pumping as you crank up the volume. The entire CD is full of keepers, especially "Where The River Flows" and "Bleed." And what can one say about the metaphysical ballad "The World I Know," other than "Play that song again!"I agree with the other reviewers that this self-titled album is Collective Soul's best. It's progressive rock with an edge: not too metal, not too alternative. I compare this band's impact ...
The best album from collective soul. All of the songs are great and the production and mixing are superb. Higly recommended for all collective soul fans.

Destiny Road | I am not sure what genre this album is ... it's not quite blues and not quite jazz and it's almost easy listening. However, with the exception of a couple lame duck songs (eg. Say That You Want To), it is very creative music. They have integrated the right amount of percussion, guitars, bass, keyboards, harmonica,and female vocals and then added in Green's husky, aged voice and came up with a very tight sound.The only thing reminiscent of Green's Fleetwood Mac are the bass and percussion. You almost expect to see John McVie and Mick Fleetwood on the credits.Anyone expecting a "Peter Green" album will be disappointed. With the Splinter Group it appears that the 'lead' is shared amongst the band members. Nigel Watson sings as much ...
Jimmy Rogers With Ronnie Earl & Broadcasters | This is an exceptional live blues album. The songs are a good mix between boogie woogie and slow blues. Although I like Ronnie Earl's guitar playing and he is truly a master, I like his guitar playing better as part of the song versus the centerpiece of the song. Therefore I liked the songs with Jimmy Rogers singing better.Call it my age, but hard driving, loud electric guitar blues is just not for me. Give me a great soulful blues singer, like Jimmy Rogers, backed up with an acoustic or slide guitar any day.Jimmy Rogers is one of the all time great bluesmen and in this album he is backed up by a great guitarist - Ronnie Earl, harmonica player - Sugar Ray, and keyboardist - Dave ...
Enlightened Rogues | The Allman Brothers HAD one of the most distinctive sounds and formulas in rock music. This album tries to ride the original Allman Brothers Band sound and fails miserably.This album came out after the decent effort of Brothers and Sisters and a hiatus when the group fought drug, financial, Cher, family, and personality problems. The go forward strategy (if there was a strategy) appeared to be let Dickey Betts and Gregg Allman write the songs independently, going with slight variations in the melodies and lyrics from previous ABB songs.By this time in the Brother's history putting out albums was almost a miracle due to the three ring circus they had going in their business and personal lives. The chemistry of the band is almost completely gone at ...
The Last Rebel | This album is great musically. No southern band puts together a tighter combination of sound with vocals, guitars, keyboards, bass, percussion, and background vocals. Lynyrd Skynyrd is pretty consistent album to album, which is kinda of my problem with them. They have a tendency to have similar melodies and rhythms with similar themes lyrically. Their albums sound alike and can be monotonous.I would not put this album up there with more recent releases such as God and Guns (I could listen to this every day) or Vicious Cycles or even older stuff such as Second Helping.However, it is worth a listen and if you can get it for a good price, worth the money.

This CD to me shows the dedication Marty has for the Great Sioux Nation.Marty speaks of significant Elders, Warriors, and the devasation at Wounded Knee. Thank you Marty for speaking the truth and once again bringing it to the light. I would definitely recommend this to others.Thank you for your prompt delivery of this CD.
Been a Marty fan for a long time, really like his theme offerings like Pilgrim. This one didn't hit my radar screen until just recently and it did not disappoint. Soulful renderings, excellent musicianship, sincere connection to the Great Spirit. A new favorite in the collection. If you are into poetry, native American wisdom, or just good country/folk music, you'll enjoy this.
Marty Stuart so far has proven to be an artist who's cd's can be bought without first hearing - they are always good. This cd is no exception. Marty and his band the Fabulous Superlatives are some of the greatest guitar based musicians on the planet. The subject matter for the disc is moving, and important. A must have.
This was a birthday gift for my husband who is Shawnee/Anishnabe and has a strong connection to his Lakota brothers. He was quite moved by the words and music of Marty Stuart, an accomplished musician. His treatment of the sensitive nature of both historical and current treatment of Native Americans is exemplary. It is obvious that he has empathy and understanding for the First Americans.

The item description is Badlands - Ballads Of The Lakota. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Marty Stuart goes the path of most resistance commercially and makes a concept album centered around a very uncomfortable social issue versus most of the country albums that currently have meaningless, superficial lyrics meant to sell as many albums as possible.<br /><br />Badlands is not the usual commercial zero calorie country fare from stars such as Big and Rich, Miranda Lambert, Gretchen Wilson, and countless others. This album has substance and a message.<br /><br />Stuart pours out his heart in a well thought out album tribute to the Lakota Sioux and the American Indian.<br /><br />This album is typical Marty Stuart; musically and lyrically well done and beautiful. Every song is a keeper.<br /><br />Marty Stuart making a record album about the Lakota Sioux hasn't changed the Lakota Sioux' life, but maybe it gets people to at least think about the atrocities these people have had to endure from the US government. Marty Stuart doing this tribute is more than most of us have done to help these people.<br /><br />Good job, Marty Stuart. Great album with meaningful lyrics and music.

Hey Kandi... | Most people know Kandi best either from her work as part of Xscape or from the numerous hits she's written for other artists. Some songs she wrote include "No Scrubs" by TLC, "Bills, Bills, Bills" by Destiny's Child and "X-Girlfriend" by Mariah Carey. Kandi knows well enough not to mess with formulas that work. That is to say, she was successful with writing male-bashing songs therefore she fills her debut with much of the same. A lot of people have said that Kandi needed more variety on her album, or that she gave away all her best material. True, Kandi's album may be a little imbalanced (at least half of the songs, excluding the intro and outro, deal with cheating men) but she pulls it off well. ...
Mandy Moore | Mandy Moore's debut did not get much success, nor did its reissued version, "I Wanna Be With You" (even though that was a great album). With her sophomore, self-titled album, Mandy takes a more hook-laden, production-heavy approach but still manages to make it work. For this offering, Mandy enlists the help of some of the big names in music including Emilio Estefan, Diane Warren, and even co-wrote a song herself. The result is a mixed bag of styles, with more great songs than missteps. Mandy's album was mostly noticed when her ballad "Cry" was used in the movie, "A Walk To Remember" which she'd also starred in. Mandy has a distinctive voice that is neither suited for powerful, vocal gymnastics like Jessica Simpson and Christina Aguilera nor ...
JoJo | Many complaints have arose about the content of Jojo's debut seeing as the singer is only thirteen years old and sings about relationships. What most people don't seem to understand is that age does not mean maturity and there is no set age for when people start dating. Many people are complaining that Jojo is far too young to be singing about breakups when nearly a decade ago, they commended artists like Aaliyah (with her song "At Your Best") for singing about "mature topics". Granted, Aaliyah was at least a year older at the time than Jojo is now however it is pretty much the same thing. That being said, Jojo's self-titled debut contains RnB-influenced tracks that will no doubt be popular with modern pop listeners.The album ...
Hurt No More Explicit Lyrics | Having the name Winans alone is probably enough to gain Mario some attention. Mario comes from a prominent family of gospel singers, most notably the four brothers who make up the gospel group, The Winans, as well as brother and sister duo BeBe and Cece Winans. Instead of following his family's footsteps and singing only gospel music, Mario decided to step up from his role as songwriter and deliver his sophomore album, "Hurts No More" in 2004. Prior to this, Mario had written songs for everyone from Tamia to Faith Evans to J. Lo. Instead of going for the standard gangster/player formula that most male R&B artists use, Mario shows us the other side: the heartbroken male. Normally, female artists have complete control over this style of ...

This album is so Hot I'm happy that her record labe FINALLY put her album out get its only 3 bad songs out of 14. Get it yopu won't be disappointed.
Yo, this is a hot album...she blew it UP! 2002 was her year for real, she had the two hottest singles in R+B, (Dont Mess With My Man and Laundromat), and some of the hottest tracks were on the album. My favorite tracks are: &quot;The One For Me&quot;, &quot;Ya Ya Ya&quot;, &quot;Run Away&quot;, and &quot;25 Reasons&quot;.
This CD is worth the money. I don't usually hype teenage acts but this one actually has talent. I only hope she gets more of a push because she's more talented than 90% of the acts that are getting all the press right now! From the first song &quot;Still In Love&quot; to &quot;Don't Mess With My Man&quot;, this CD is very good!
I really love this cd, its one of the best cd's i bought this year. My favorite songs on this cd is ,the one for me and just in case actually i like the hole cd no song is bad except for Laundromat on the other hand, it makes no since but overrall its a nice cd!!! I look forward to seeing more nivea projects in the future!!

The item description is Nivea. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Nivea Hamilton debuted at a time when there was an onslaught of female singers, thus her debut went virtually unnoticed except for her hit single "Don't Mess With My Man". Nivea's self-titled debut took a more hip-hop flavoured approach then many other singers. Nivea packs in quite a few guest aritsts, including Lil Wayne, Nick Cannon and a couple of members of Jagged Edge. True, Nivea does not have the most powerful voice per se, but she and her producers definitely know how to work with her abilities. Unlike most artists who attempt it, the hip-hop style actually works for Nivea though I would not have minded if there were fewer guest artists on this. It's not that they sound bad, there are just a few too  many of them.<br /><br />Nivea starts things off with "Still In Love", a catchy song that shows off Nivea's sweet vocals. The song tells how Nivea is still in love with someone despite any problems they have. It's not particularly original or creative in any way however it gives us a good introduction to Nivea's vocal style. "Ya Ya Ya" features Lil Wayne and a large amount of hip-hop slang. However, unlike with other artists, Nivea pulls it off well making it sound completely natural. It's quite hard to follow what this is supposed to be about but it is a good song nonetheless. Lil Wayne's rap is nothing too special but is a nice addition to the song, as it sounds quite good with Nivea's vocals. The first single, "Don't Mess With My Man", with Brian and Brandon Casey is up next. The song talks about people who try to flirt with Nivea and the Casey brothers' boyfriend and girlfriends respectively and how the three warn them to stay away. The bridge in particular sounds great. ("Girl I'm warning you, if you want my man...").<br /><br />"The One For Me" is a sweet, slow song about meeting someone who you know immediately is "the one". Nivea sounds extremely sweet in this song and her vocals fit exceptionally with the song. The chorus sounds particularly great to me (vocally) though I am not sure why. This was the first song on the album that Nivea co-wrote and it features an unaccredited male rapper. After that comes my favourite song from this album, "Laundromat" written by and featuring R. Kelly. The two singers perform this as if they were a couple arguing, an effect which sometimes ruins songs. Luckily, it works exceptionally well. Nivea sounds genuinely hurt/angry and her vocals sound great with R Kelly's. "You Don't Even Know" is a more upbeat track has awesome vocals and production even though the lyrics are not the greatest.  Nick Cannon's rap is pretty average but isn't enough to really hinder the song. Better yet is Nivea's short rap, which outshines Nick and actually suits her pretty well, though I can't see a full album of it actually sounding good.<br /><br />"Run Away" is one of my favourites, especially because of Nivea's vocals. The rapper in this one, Pusha T of Clipse, is one of the better guest stars though it is not really him I'm listening to on this song. This song was produced by the Neptunes, and they actually manage to make Nivea sound amazing. Lyrically, it is quite good as well and the chorus in particular is great. ("Said I wanna be with you, why'd you have to go and run away?"). Also, Nivea's verse immediately following the rap sounds incredible. "Just In Case", on the other hand, is decent but not one of the best songs. It talks about Nivea giving a guy her number in case he decides to cheat on his girl later. Despite the poor message, Nivea still manages to make this sound alluring and so it is not nearly as bad as it could have been. "No Doubt" is one of my two least favourite songs on here. Nivea's vocals are on point, and the song is quite sweet and the lyrics are not terrible. However, the chorus is far too repetitive which takes away from the overall quality. "Never Had A Girl Like Me" is another upbeat song, which is incredibly catchy. The bidge in particular sounds great. ("You know you would if you could..."). It is not necessarily memorable, but it is definitely worth a listen.<br /><br />"Have Mercy" is one of the few slow songs, and it talks about how Nivea asks her man to have mercy on her because she cheated on him. The vocals are beautiful and sweet yet the song is a little too repetitive. Nonetheless, it is far from an awful song and it showcases a softer, more vulnerable side to Nivea. After this comes my least favourite song, "Don't Mess With The Radio". I do not really understand how this was ever released as a single or even how it made the album, as it is repetitive and extremely hard to follow. "25 Reasons" is much better. In it, Nivea goes through a list of twenty-five reasons why she loves her man. It takes a little while to grow on you, but once it does, it will seem incredibly beautiful. Lastly, there is an unnecessary, mediocre remix of "Don't Mess With My Man" which could have been replaced with something more original.<br /><br />Overall Mark: 4/5<br /><br />Though the album seems to (as a whole) lose steam towards the end, it is definitely worth a listen. Nivea has a great voice and it is too bad she did not get the exposure that she should have. I wish some of the songs from the re-released version of this album (though I've never heard them) could have been on the original. Nivea is supposed to be releasing a sophomore album in 2005, and if it is anything like this one, it should be exceptional. Nivea needs to lay off the guest stars a little, and let her own talents shine through more often. Otherwise, this is excellent.

Equinox | Is there such a thing as "pretty" hard rock? This first recording by the band for the A&M label may be it. Here, you will find power guitar chords accented with sweet, mellifluous harmonies. It took Styx five albums to achieve the perfection they found on Equinox. This is the best and, in my opinion, the last Styx album. With John Curulewski's departure and Tommy Shaw's arrival on "Crystal Ball," the band became less a cohesive unit and more a compilation of solo projects. Hear Styx during this rare moment of power, creativity and innocence.
Kilroy Was Here | ***********************TONIGHT ONLY************************************************PUPPET SHOW*************************************************SPINAL TAP****************************************STYX: PERFORMING "KILROY WAS HERE"**************
Sabotage | Black Sabbath changed their sound on every album. The first song on Sabotage, Hole In The Sky, continues the move away from the deep, moaning guitar riffs found on albums preceding Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, replaced by a crisper, metallic sting. Where in the past, Iommi's bar chords resembled the strike of a single, heavy string tuned very low, there is now a discernible blend of notes. Though the tone of the record is dark, the sound is relatively bright compared to past efforts. The production is analog perfection.Am I Going Insane was reportedly slated for Osbourne's ill-fated solo project. It was clearly produced with hopes of radio airplay, but it was Symptom Of The Universe that made its way to the FM airwaves in nineteen seventy-five. Its ...
Technical Ecstasy | In 1976, disco ruled. While in England, punk bands, hoping for their piece of the music money pie, were using the tried and true method of dismissing successful bands as passe, referring to them as "dinosaurs" or "corporate." The demise of heavy metal was imminent according to rock rags, and so bands were under pressure to tone down and lighten up...or funk it up. Enter Black Sabbath's seventh studio release.If "Technical Ecstasy" had been recorded by any other band it would probably have been considered a fairly good rock album; but this was Black Sabbath, and fans had come to expect more. Iommi seemed finally to have run out of great guitar riffs, causing Osbourne to work with substandard material. Though the guitar still sounds like no ...

Why should I feel guilty for liking this band, when millions of polyester clad morons shook their booties to disco? And even in the nineties - talk about asinine music that isn't even interesting.Back in the 70's, no one knew that they were supposed to be embarrassed when laying down their 5 bucks for an Angel album. What can I say, this album is filled with catchy tunes and guitar work and terrible marketing. Can anyone say &quot;Spinal Tap?&quot;Give me the 70's any day!
Okay, I'll admit that this review may seem high, but only if you're not an Angel fan. I think that this is their best overall album and truly enjoy most of the songs. There are times I wish they would lower the range of the music and vocals because at times it seems as if the band is playing the notes too high and the vocalist has to scream the lyrics to keep up. But for the most part, this is a good Summer album for driving around and remembering high school. And hey, what can you say about the cover art featuring a bunch of tall skinny white guys in spandex?Very cool!
I remember when this originally debuted in the '70's. It was a real hot album with lots of rocking tunes. Really cool in this album is Gregg Guifria's work on the keyboards. Some great use of sytnhs combined with a little hard rock. Each song is a real pop masterpiece in its own right.
ANGEL IS A BAND WAY AHEAD OF THEIR TIME. WITH ANY LABEL SUPPORT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN AS BIG AS ANY BAND IN THE 70'S. NOT ONE BAD SONG ON THIS CD, A SMOOTH LISTEN FROM START TO FINISH. FROM THE KICK ... STYLE OF 'GOT LOVE IF YOU WANT IT' TO THE HEART WRENCHING BALLAD OF 'BROKEN WINGS' TO THE SPIRITUAL ENDING OF 'THE WINTER SONG' (LATER CHANGED LYRICALLY TO 'THE CHRISTMAS SONG' ON THE ANTHOLOGY CD) THIS CD HAS IT ALL. A MUST FOR ANY COLLECTION.

The item description is White Hot. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I don't know if record companies in the late seventies were making the decision for the bands, but many hard rock rookies of the time -- who had solid first-album offerings -- abruptly made the switch to cutesy pop music.  It could have been the influence of disco, which many saw as the future of the music industry and the killer of heavy metal.  Maybe it was the success of bands like Styx and Queen, who had abandoned their hard rock roots to achieve superstar status as pop bands, that provided the impetus, but it turned out to be death for many young bands.  Angel's self-titled first album was a combination of hard rock and synthesizer that came as a welcome surprise to a tired and directionless market.  They exploded on to the scene polished and confident.  There was no rough draft, test-the-water debut; they entered the rock arena in full stride.  It seemed they were destined for stardom.  The sound wore a bit thin on "Helluva Band," their follow-up album, but it was not uncommon for a band to struggle a bit on their second effort.  They were building a metal following, which, in the seventies, seemed the best way to sustained success.  But, then it happened: along with new bands like Legs Diamond, Starz and Prism, Angel went bubblegum.  The songs on "White Hot" make Donny Osmond's "Puppy Love" sound like death metal.  Hard rock fans couldn't bail fast enough.  The band became an embarrassment.  Alas, the end of a band that appeared headed for stadium status.  Note: Angel did have a bit in their stage performance which clearly inspired a scene in the movie "Spinal Tap."  While the bit failed in "Spinal Tap," it was actually fun to watch during Angel's early performances, sort of a mix of magic and music.  Buy the first album and run.

Output: Review: ANGEL IS A BAND WAY AH

R.U.L.E. explicit_lyrics | I am not much of a Ja Rule fan but Venni Vetti Vecci was a tyte CD. After that he just fell off his game.What made is worse is that he missed with calling with making good rhymes to becoming an R&B singer. So basically he would rather make more money doing something he sucks at than keeping the respect of his fans with his real style? LOL
Guerilla City | Now we have some choke artist like Guerilla Black trying to be a Big impersonator. Biggie is from NY, not Cali. And its funny how people are mad that we are saying hes a Biggie wannabe. If you want to hear some Biggie, go buy and listen to Ready To Die, Life After Death and Born Again. You know its true so admit it and get off this mans nads.
Crunk Juice | Some of the beats are real good but Lil Jon doesn't say anything.Lil Jon just needs to dump the ESB, quit crunk music, learn to rap and I bet he will be serious. He has the beats just need the content.I wish I could give this negative stars.
Street's Disciple Explicit Lyrics | This 2-disc could have been just put into 1 disc. I guess Nas felt left out that 2pac, Jay, Biggie, and others can make a 2 disc, why cant I? lolAlot of the songs I was feeling but yo who is this Scarlett chick? She killed Live Now and the other one. Kelis made American Way suck balls at the end. Nas needs to make a CDE with just him like Illmatic. Why is Ludacris on this album btw?

I hear all these reviews about 2pac and his boys and how his new CD is the best. It is good. But i also hear everybody callin DMX's stuff old, when 2pac's CD is made of stuff 5 years old.

Livin' on the Fault Line | Livin' On the Fault Line by Doobie Brothers1977 era, Really good Rock and Vocals from one of the best stage and recording bands of the . . ., well, They are still here, just not Michael McDonald, as I saw them earlier this year in Biloxi at the IP. Really enjoyed their show and this old Albumn from my earlier years. They even made a little joke about Michael McDonald, in good taste, as many don't like the era when he joined the Doobies when Tom Johnston left to recouperate. Most of this recording and music, as were several albums, mostly Michael and I feel, if he had not come along at that time, we may not have the Doobies today. They may have faded with out ...
Lovers | I wanted this album, as a reminder of the past years when Bobby, Eric, Duane and others entertained us on the best rock album ever done. Would have wished him to sing Thorntree in the Garden again on this album, as I still think it is one of his and the origional Dominos best. Thanks Bobby.
Undercover | Another Tim Weisberg CD to add to your collection. Lots of Flute on this as others by tim.
Stampede | Stampede by Doobie Brothers - I recently purchased all the Old Doobies music. This is another Great Doobies presentation. In 1975, the Doobies were trying to keep up the Music production of Several successful Albums. Although not the success of earlier Records, they provide more of the good music we expect from them, even if the Album cover was cheesy.

Made in CAN in 2000, Serial# KOC-CD-8821, Playing Time 59:12The last time I bought a DB album was in 1991, when they released &quot;Brotherhood&quot; (I don't count the live set nor the box set).First of all, the disc contains a multimedia track full of features (lyrics to the album, a DB skin for Windows Media Player, some freeware), but most interesting is the 7-minute video of &quot;Long Train Runnin'&quot; filmed in Las Vegas in June 2000. And it rocks! The band is having a great time, and the rendition is very exciting, with the addition of Marc Russo on sax, along with a brief but funky bass solo, as well as a little drum duet, viewed through the DB's skin that you can download.The album in itself ...
The Doobies never cease to surprise and amaze. &quot;Sibling Rivaly&quot; shows a new smooth and soulful Doobie side with a good dose of acoustic guitar work and reflective, social-minded and spiritual lyrics. Violin and sax solos exist in places you would expect guitar but they fit well and give the songs nice dimension. &quot;Sibling Rivaly&quot; also shows they haven't forgotten their roots as a guitar dominated rock and roll band that can kick it out as well as anyone. For Tom Johnston fans, he is on top of his game and better than ever. &quot;People Gotta Love Again&quot;, &quot;Jericho&quot;, &quot;45 Floor&quot; and &quot;Higher Ground&quot; are vintage Johnston but at the same time demonstrate growth, depth and a new energy. You won't be disappointed. He also handles lead ...
I bought this on a whim when I got the "Live at Wolf Trap" DVD (one word - awesome!), and was very surprised by this effort. It's quite good, although if you're looking for more of the old Doobies' style of rock, this ain't it. I would say this is a solid entry in the Adult Contemporary genre, which is undoubtedly why it got very little radio airplay. It's very well done, but it won't appeal to today's kiddies. A couple of the tunes were a bit overdone ("Jericho," "45th Floor"), but much of the disc was/is outstanding. I particularly liked "Angels of Madness," and wonder how big a hit it might have been had the album been released even 10 years ago instead of 2000.
Several months ago I saw the Doobies on a listening station at a music store. I had no idea a new disc was released. Upon listening, I knew immediately Sibling Rivalry was a winner. The disc not only incorporates their signature sound, but includes some very fresh new sounds as well. The Doobies' musicianship is extraordinary. Instrumentals and vocals reflect how this veteran band keeps rockin'like a finely tuned engine. The overall product is slick, diverse, expected, new, exciting, and sure to please the &quot;die-hard&quot; Doobie fan.&quot; Rocking Horse &quot;is one of my favorite tracks, followed by &quot;On Every Corner&quot;. Sibling Rivalry is one of the discs I keep playing over and over, and is great driving music.

The item description is Sibling Rivalry. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Sibling Rivalry by Doobie Brothers<br />Really nice Artwork by Stanley Mouse on the Cover, compliments to Art Director - Michael A.Beck  More Great music from Johnston, McFee, Simmons, Knudsen and Hossack. Guy Allison, All keyboards, but not a Doobie?? Thirteen cuts from 2000!  Doobies give you your monies' worth.  The Doobie Vocals with Johnston, Simmons, McFee with singing drummers to boot.  I just can't say enough about what I know John McFee brings to the table!  Harmonies, hand clapping, driving beats and sliding riffs.  That's just on the first cut. This is the Doobies I love and they continue to produce year after year.  Go see them, you'll see.  Maybe not hear afterward, cause they turn it up like in the Seventies, Eighties and Nineties.  Yea, I've seen them in all those decades.  I still listen to them as much as about any music I have!  And they still have something to say in their music.  Not just an Entertaining Pretty Face on stage there.  These old guys still rock like it is supposed to be done. Try a listen, compare it to what is new out there and see if it still isn't superior to what you can choose to buy.  Superior Guitar, Rythem and Bluesy Rock.  Pop and Fun too.  Who has two Drummers??  No, I don't work for them, I just like what they do.  Put it on when your Relitives are over for a backyard BBQ or a anniversary celebration.  They'll be glad you did!

Output: Review: "Livin' on the Fault Line" is a great album, and I'm glad I bought it. It's a great album, and I'm glad I bought it. I'm not sure if it's the same as the previous albums, but it's still a great album. I'm not sure if it's the same as the previous albums, but it's still a great album.

Some of these reviewers are somehow fooled by its description of the cds enclosed with this edition of Fired Up!. Amazon.com offers two versions of Fired Up!, the one disc and the two disc. As long as you READ what you are buying you should have no trouble. Anyhow, the cd is nice for keeping you pump, either the one disc or two disc. Please READ before buying, and remember they are BOTH offered, just READ!
This is a near perfect dance album. It's a sort of follow-up to the smash 2001 hit &quot;Pulse.&quot; But while &quot;Pulse&quot; consisted of mainly early/mid 90's dance hits, &quot;Fired Up&quot; continues on ranging from the mid-90's into 2000. Although this compilation consists of club music, some were actually pretty big hits at pop radio too namely the songs by Deborah Cox, ATC, Amber, Gina G, Alice Deejay and Eiffel 65.It's a very good listen overall, but there are definite stand-outs. Melanie C.'s #1 dance/club smash &quot;I Turn To You&quot; is an awesome track and it's too bad that it never crossed over to American radio. ATC's &quot;Around the World&quot; was an irresistible club and radio smash back in the spring of 2001. Alice Deejay had a huge ...
I had no idea there was a 2 disc version until I was looking for a song title for a friend tonight. I purchased the single disc version at a store earlier this year and it has been a constant in my gym bag ever since. It's got consistant enough beats to make a workout go by quickly and when set on random play it varies the workout enough to keep me from getting bored.For those who are complaining about the disc length, check the song list before purchasing. That's a dead giveaway that it's a single disc.
This double album has plenty of songs on it from a certain era. Some of the songs seem a bit dated, but it has about ten real winners on it. It could be for you.

Just recently I've gotten pretty into Dream Street, so I decided to try out this solo album. Though I would have loved a few more tracks (9 bucks for 3 songs seems kinda expensive, but it's worth it!), it's awesome.Why Don't You Kiss Her is my favorite song, it's sooooo pretty and I think everyone can relate to it, male or female. Don't You is pretty good, but it's probably the weakest on the album. It's, I dunno, too...boy bandish. Beautiful Soul, the other track on the CD is great too, I love it just as much as Why Don't You Kiss Her, but it isn't as powerful/beautiful.This is strongly recommended, even though there's only 3 tracks. It's amazing, and I will definately be looking for more ...

Target: I'd never been a fan of DreamStreet until I met Jesse McCartney when he judged a local singing competition I was in.  At first I just checked him out with a somewhat feeble hope of buttering him up in the competition, but I soon became hooked on his voice.  It's very mature for someone his age, and when I listened to some old DreamStreet stuff, I was amazed at how well his singing voice has matured over the years.  His songs aren't the greatest, but the acoustic version of &quot;Don't You&quot; (just keep listening to Track 3) allows you to hear him really sing.  Jesse is talented, and despite the stereotype that all pop stars are arrogant &amp;%@#!@#$s, I can tell you from experience that he's anything but arrogant.  He's a sweet kid (he gave me this CD for free), an awesome performer...oh yeah, and hot, but that doesn't matter...

On the music front, they combined their native Mediterranean roots with a jazz atmosphere. Lyrically, Madrugada addressed environmental issues, such as how Mother Nature and her image were lost to both pollution and the lack of open space. These words were not simplistic naive solutions, but rather well-thought out educated ideas."I may try and listen to the entire disc sometime; but right now; I'm too disappointed, ...
Strangelands | I love it -- beware though - this is definitely geared to the Arthur Brown completist. If you are newly discovering AB's work - I suggest other releases.

If you went into the revival of The Rocky Horror Show expecting the movie, you got a big surprise. The sings, in my opinion, have been improved, being played more up-tempo and mroe like rock songs!! Great performances by all! Just a great show!
I saw Rocky Horror on Broadway several years ago and had forgotten how much fun it was! This CD brought back all the memories of a great show, an incredible cast, and the energy that I felt in the New York theatre. If you're a Rocky fan, this is a must for your collection. Raul Esparza's voice will blow your hair back!!
This revival is not as good as the original but the opening is SUPER> The overture, hard rock, and cheer are a great opening for the show. We used this when we did Rocky last year. The audience LOVED it.
This is my favorite recording of all the &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; recordings. It sounds so fresh and and in your face. Every cast member is amazing! Especially Alice Ripley! I love her voice.

Casey Abrams | I loved Casey Abrams when he was on American Idol, and although he wasn’t as dramatic a singer as other finalists, he is an accomplished musician and gifted songwriter, and this album sounds like artistry rather than the often-artificial marketingy-sounding albums that emerge from American Idol winners. This is a lovely, upbeat, funky sound, a little like Jason Mraz but with a bit of a bluesey/Jazz twist every so often. My favourites are the ones towards the end, the more jazzy ones, and his doublebass playing still gives me chills, It’s the kind of music you want to sing along to in your car on a sunny day, or to put on at the start of the evening for a relaxed dinner party. (His duet at the ...
Ghosts Upon the Earth | This is Gungor’s second album. I’ve had this album for a while – probably a year, but initially I was quite disappointed with it. It’s not very easy listening, and I found it all a bit too much for putting on in the car or singing along to. And then one day in January I put it on and listened to it whilst lying down and doing nothing else, and it was a complete REVELATION. These guys are geniuses (genii?) This is straight-up amazing. One of my friends who is something of a poet-artist-monk said this is her favourite album of all time, and now I understand why. If you are something of a poet-artist-monk and want to listen to Christian music that celebrates creativity and is ...
Fortunate Fall | On my quest to find ‘Christian music that doesn’t sound too Christian’ I heard her singing at the RELEVANT magazine sessions, and I was hooked. Her voice is beautiful and melancholy, and she sings beautiful songs of the goodness of God, but in a minor key. My friend commented: ‘it takes a mature Christian to sing of the goodness of God in a minor key’, and I love the theological depth and the sense of holding on to God when you don’t understand. This is really worth listening to – I find it really moving.
The Civil Wars | I was watching Nashville and thinking how wonderful it would be if Gunner and Scarlet sang together in real life – and then I came across The Civil Wars and realised that’s probably as close as you could get. Their music is deliciously melancholic, and their acoustic sound and haunting harmonies have a good bit of bite. I loved both of their albums, but their second album, The Civil Wars, was just exquisitely done, with so many hypnotically good tracks. I was sorry to learn that they had split up – their music is amazing.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Dear Music Appreciators,Until this album I knew Joy Williams only as the female half of “The Civil Wars,” an Americana duo known for having their own little wars between themselves. Interesting that she should mark her return to a solo career with an opening track that samples Robert Frost, one of the great “Americana” poets of the twentieth century, a man who was probably no stranger to conflict, who has the words “I had a lover’s quarrel with the world” engraved on his gravestone.Notice the album cover - the photograph suggests a woman exposed, surrounded by darkness, and if I remember anything from my film study classes I remember that when a character is covered with those horizontal shadow lines from the venetian blinds, they might be ...
Powerful--I just downloaded and listened through the whole album and was really moved by the lyrics and Joy's voice. The emotion has a basis which is what I resonated with. I'm a bit more familiar with her career than the first reviewer and can say that it's been incredible listening to her progression from her Christian albums to the Civil Wars and now to a more mature and reflective sound. It's certainly worth purchasing and listening to.
Clearly Joy Williams has been on quite a journey since the split of The Civil Wars. Venus shares a bit of that journey which is full of vulnerability and power, big beats and quiet vocals and everything in-between. There are times when Joy Williams, the soloist, is reminiscent of the partner in The Civil Wars, but much of her work reaches out in new ways of expression. As the mythic Venus was born out of the sea, Ms. Williams’ career has a rebirth (her second since her Contemporary Christian artist days) and this album is indicative of that change. While I will deeply miss the harmonies of The Civil Wars, I’m excited about the new album and where Ms. Williams is heading. Yes, we hear her haunting, ...
This is the first CD I have bought in like 5 years Joy! I support you absolutely and I am amazed at the similarities I am having with you when it comes to finding yourself through rough trials, I lost my mom years ago and never let myself deal with the pain until I got married, now being married, finding out more and more about WHO I am as a person that isn't CONSTANTLY influenced by others and what they think is best for my life. It's hard because I know that I will lose the love of many if I show who I truly am. I'm not who they WANT me to be, I am ME.. Gabrielle and trying to be me is a lot harder ...

The item description is VENUS. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Joy Williams’ first album post-Civil Wars. Sometimes her voice sounds a bit Celine Dion, sometimes a bit Tori Amos. It took me a while to get out of the ‘It’s only half of the Civil Wars’ headspace, but once I did, I was hooked. This is musically dark and sophisticated, and really haunting.

Output: The Civil Wars's lead singer, Venus, is a great singer, and the album is a great example of her solo career.

I have always Jon B been a fan and like others have said i was a little skeptical when i heard that he was releasing a new album but soon became to like "Oh so sexy" from listening to it on his myspace. I originally bought the cd for that one song and out of support but when i listened to it i literally loved every song. Each song has its own personally and is placed in just the right way that it flows perfectly. Jon has done it again.
Oh so sexy is one of my al time faves. Can listen to this track on repeat all the time. Just that one song makes the whole album worth buying.
This is truly one of Jon's greatest cds. I can listen to it pretty much from beginning to end, which is a rare thing for me cuz I love to skip to my favorite tracks. It's U has to be my favorite jam on the album but all the songs on there are banging! Only thing, I will say is that I think that he could have pushed his vocal range a little bit more. He was kinda chilling on the vocal range in the mid area. But it's all good. It's still better than John Legend's Evolver cd. I did a straight up end to end comparison of the two and Jon B came out on top. John Legend tried to evolve a bit too much ...
If I could give this album 10 stars, I would! It was well worth the wait. Jon B never strays from his original and timeless sound. Never dissapoints! All Jon B fans, get the album!!

Keep It Up | I used to love Loverboy back in the 80's. I thought they were going to become and remain huge. What they really were was a fad and this album was the beginning of the end for them.I think this is actually a very good album, but the singles, "Queen Of The Broken Hearts" and "Hot Girls In Love," are definitely not the best songs. I think they were released as singles merely because they "sounded" like some of their other hits (most notably, "Working For The Weekend"). Most of the other songs on this album are way better than those two.If you like classic Loverboy, I highly recommend this one.
Worlds Apart | "World's Apart" is without a doubt Saga's true masterpiece. It is the perfect marriage of art and commerce. The songs are all prog-rock with enough universal appeal to be pop hits. From the writing (music and lyrics), arrangements, sound quality, musicianship, etc...it all works. If you buy only one Saga album, make it this one.I don't understand why they changed the album cover for the remastered version, though. I'm guessing that the original one was imposed on them by the record company looking to add a little sex appeal to their image.Whatever the case, you can't lose with "World's Apart." Best tracks are ALL OF THEM! Great from beginning to end. My favorite, however, is "Wind Him Up." I haven't been able to get it out of ...
Shaken & Stirred | I love this album. Not that I don't like other Plant solo albums ("Pictures" and "Principle" are outstanding) but "Shaken" is pure Robert Plant (with his original and best band) without any hint of his past or any other influences. Actually, to be fair, the one influence shown here is the times in which it was recorded (dead center of the 80's). That happens to be my favorite period in pop music history (late 70's and 80's) just because it was the last truly original period. Everything since then has been a rehash of other decades. "Shaken 'N Stirred" is Robert Plant's final, pure, artistic statement. All of his efforts since then (although note-worthy on their own) reeked of capturing past glory or desperately searching for pop ...
Frontiers | I recently bought this album and was very surprised by how much it actually rocks. None of the singles that I heard from "Frontiers" over the years impressed me much (other than "Send Her My Love," which is arguably Journey's best ballad ever).The first half of the album is very good, but it really takes off starting with "Edge Of The Blade." I believe that "Frontiers" is a worthy follow up to "Escape," Journey's best hard-rock album ever. The only misstep is "Back Talk," which is too heavy metal (in a bad sort of 80's way) and not conducive to Steve Perry's vocal style at all.Stand-out tracks according to me: "Edge Of The Blade," "Troubled Child," "Frontiers," "Rubicon," "Send Her My Love," "Chain Reaction," and "After The ...

&quot;Get Lucky&quot; is Loverboy's best album. When I was in middle school in the early to mid 1980s, this was my favorite album. I had it on cassette, and I played it so much that I wore it out.Everyobdy knows the song &quot;Working for the Weekend.&quot; It's a truly great song. But it isn't necessarily the best song on here. Actually, there's so much diversity on this CD, it's somewhat hard to say what the best song really is.&quot;Take Me to the Top&quot; gets big credit for experimenting with non-conventional song structure. That keyboard riff is so awesome! And then combine it with all the other great instruments, and Mike Reno's perfect singing, and you have a true classic.&quot;Jump&quot; is also excellent.

THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CD'S OF THE EARLY 80'S..LOVERVOY--GET LUCKY--MULTI-PLATINUM ALBUM WITH SOME OF THE BAND'S BEST HITS,SUCH AS...WORKING FOR THE WEEKEND--WHEN IT'S OVER--JUMP--GANGS IN THE STREET--LUCKY ONE--TAKE ME TO THE TOP--ALL THEIR GREATEST HITS CAME FROM THIS GREAT ALBUM..GET LUCKY IS A CLASSIC...A MUST HAVE!
If you are desperate to own a Loverboy album, then you probably want to buy this one.This was the last of this bands success [and only real success], so enjoy it while it lasts. As one of their songs says, they were the LUCKY ONES.And another song points out well, this one TOOK THEM TO THE TOP.But they fell fast after that.The got EMOTIONAL too.WATCH OUT, because IT'S YOUR LIFE.

Well, they are probably working weekdays now flipping hamburgers, but who knows...The GANGS IN THE STREET took over music a little later with Rap, which these guys could never do.And, WHEN IT&quot;S OVER they only left us with this one short album to remember them by.Listen ...
One word: HOT! Just check out this CD's album cover and you'll see what I mean - these guys rock HOT!! Even just the song titles get me pumped to rock hard and jam the night away with my weekend friends. Speaking of weekends, this CD features the all-time classic hard-rocker "Everybody's Working for the Weekend," a classic rock staple that is an anthem everywhere for people who work 40 hours a week or over. If you're an adult above the age of 18, I think you know what I'm talkin' about...get ready for a song dedicated to YOU!!Still, this smokin' record features other less popular anthems that were never released as singles but were just as good. For instance, "Gangs in the Street" is about the ...

The item description is Get Lucky. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: "Get Lucky" is without a doubt Loverboy's best album.  Great songs from beginning to end.<br /><br />'Nuff said.

Output: Loverboy's best album. When I was in middle school in the early to mid 1980s, this was my favorite album. I had it on cassette, and I played it so much that I wore it out. Everyobdy knows the song &quot;Working for the Weekend.&quot; It's a truly great song. But it isn't necessarily the best song on here. Actually, there's so much diversity on this CD, it's somewhat hard to say what the best song really is.&quot; Take Me to the Top&quot;

Rocky Horror Picture Show | I saw the stage production of this in LA at the Roxy in 1974 with Tim Curry and Meatloaf. What an amazing experience. I also own the movie, which is absolutely incredible. It surpasses the live performance because of the pool scene, so HOT! Anyway, the music is pure rock and roll and the lyrics are complex and brilliant. I don't know how Richard O'Brien did it. Get this and really listen to it. I especially love "Don't Dream It, Be It" and "I'm Going Home." Now go do the Time Warp, again!
Classic Sinatra | If you like Frankie, you'll love this, but I like Sinatra Reprise: The Very Good Years better. However, on both, I know it's normal for the times, but I get tired of the band's sound of too much horn and drums. The backgrounds sound all the same to me, it's his voice that's so beautiful, too bad that's the way it was done then even for Dean Martin and Perry Como, etc.
Opera - The Ultimate Collection | Great opera selections with the wonderful voice of Mr. Bocelli.
Very Good Years | This is better than Classic Sinatra because of the song choices, but still don't care for the band's use of too much horn and drums which was typical of the times. It's his voice that's great.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
The set is full of great artists n most recordings are clear but live recordings fall into worse than bootleg quality. It cheapened the entire presentation as a hurry up project to make money from Amy's recent demise ASAP. Sad because Amy wouldn't dig it put together like this. She'd want the best representation of these artists. So 8 out of 26 are very low quality disappointing recordings.
Music on cd is great,but most likely found in other jazz or blues collections.Recommend the cd if like Amy's style of singing.
I really don't know how much this music inspired Amy, but feel selling a very ordinary but strange compilation using her name was a nice little trick that many including self got caught to! :) can't blame anybody much but myself for not taking time to review the songs before purchase so being fair and giving it 3 stars.Compilation 3 starsQuality - 2.5 stars
now i know why she was such a great singer and made great songs and beats that just soothed you.
