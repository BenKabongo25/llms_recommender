Sino | What can you say about a lady with such a powerful and yet delicate voice who can still keep it up after so many decades on the stage? And Mercedes Sosa is a native American i.e. &quot;Indian&quot;, it's rare that someone from that background succeds as much as Mercedes has done.And she's proud of it! One song on this album, &quot;Cinco Siglos Igual&quot; chronicles the destuction of the Americas in the 500 since Columbus, but does so in an elliptical, poetic, moving fashion.This particular album is pure pleasure and fascination, never a dull song. She belts out the definitive rendition of &quot;La Ultima Curda&quot;(The Last Binge), and the orchestra really takes you along for the ride; the song compares the churning of a drunkard's innards to the ...
Sin & Soul...And Then Some | My musical tastes are mostly classical, but Brown is of such calibre that he easily fits in with Shostakovich, Beethoven, Weber, the great composers. Each song has the ability to take you into a separate complete universe...&quot;heaven and hell&quot;. I reckon that Brown is America's greatest living vocalist.
Britten: Les Illuminations op. 18 / Serenade op. 31 | The &quot;Serenade&quot; has to be Britten's most compressed and dramatic work; all the force of his greatest operas is distilled into a few minutes. Listen to the opening horn-solo;in just a few seconds, it establishes the otherworldly atmosphere that prevails throughout the work. It is scored for the natural horn,and its rough, dark tones bring out the qualities perfectly. ....The Serenade was written in 1942, and you can hear the Blitz as an undertone to almost every note. Yet it is overtly just a nocturnal, a piece about the approach of night, with poems drawn the finest of five centuries of English literature. The &quot;Dirge&quot; is such a tour-de-force that it might cause us to overlook the other pieces, but this would be a mistake. The wonderful ...

The typical musical has you leaving the theater humming catchy tunes and a feel good outlook on life. In Sondheim's &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; (which is really an opera) a listener or theater-goer leaves the theater moved, frightened, laughing, and yet questioning goodness in human nature!I got to see this musical on Broadway, with this particular cast, and have never seen anything quite like it since. Len Cariou, Angela Lansbury and the rest of this exquisite cast created a comical, romantic freak show in which the good guy did not always come out on top. If you do not know this show, it would be good to find out more about it before you buy it. My email address is listed in my &quot;about me&quot; page. I would be ...
Stephen Sondheim has now earned the title of &quot;Master of the Macabre Musical&quot; in my book for composing this remarkable piece. With stories of revenge, murder, love, and (literally)man-made pies. Sondheim is the only man I know who could make a musical about London's most notorious homicidal pair. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and his accomplice Nellie Lovett, into an unique, and melodic masterpiece. I couldn't picture anyone else accomplishing such a task. Sondheim simply shows that, if done correctly you can turn anything into a musical masterpiece. The story begins with our protagonist (forcefully played by Len Cariou) arriving back in London after spending fifteen years in Bedlam, when his wife and child were stolen from him by corrupt Judge Turpin. He goes ...
Inspired by old British folklore and a melodramatic play about a murderous barber whose neighbor bakes his victims into meat pies, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; is not only a true musical thriller, a blood chilling piece of theater, but the very best score composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim has given us to date. Set against the back drop of industrial revloution London, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; tells the tale of Benjamin Barker, a good man sent to prison by a lecherous Judge Turpin who covets Barker's wife, Lucy. As the musical begins, Barker has escaped prison, assumed the name Sweeney Todd, and returns to London with revenge in his heart and a need to find his wife, Lucy, and their daughter, Johanna. Todd turns to Mrs. Lovett, his pie baking neighbor from his ...
strictly speaking,from a musical standpoint(i.e.composer not tunesmith)The art of the american musical(or opera)has three fountain-head landmarks,that have any shot at immortality.a holy trinity, and in this order.gershwin's porgy and bess,sondheim's SWEENEY TODD,and bernstein's(and sondheim's)west side story.Period.
When, as a teen, I sat down to watch this cast in the London production of Sondheim's hit in 1980, I had little idea of how blown away I'd be. The next couple of hours were a revelation. &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; was popular theatre, but it was operatic, with gorgeously constructed songs. It was escapist melodrama, but it was also scathing social commentary. It was excruciatingly funny at times, and at others so wrenching and elegiac I wept, and so did the two teen-aged guys with me! It threw me into an uproar, and I burned to know: who writes stuff like this? And who the heck is Stephen Sondheim?&quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; maintains such a rabid following principally because the songwriting is so masterful. Nobody manipulates mood quite like ...
I'm glad I took the advice of the other reviewers and purchased this full soundtrack album rather than the highlights. Only being familiar with the televised production of this bizarre and wonderful musical, I was intrigued to hear several pieces that were cut from the televised release. (Warning though. . .the Judge's ode to Johanna is really twisted, I won't describe it, you just got to listen and you'll get the point) My only disappointment is that there is no recording of this work with George Hearn who stared in the television version. He adds a hysterical mania to his performance, especially in the frightful &quot;Epiphany&quot; which is riveting and lacking in Len Cariou's far more subdued presentation. If you can find a video copy, by all ...
To say that this recording isn't amazing would be ridiculous. Sondheim's lyric and tonal skills are unmatched in the current Broadway scene. With a mix of severe atonality and dissonance coupled with beautifully crafted melodic lines this musical borders on operatic qualification. This musical is something that anyone will love...even me, a 19 year old. The only flaw I can find in this recording is the performance of Len Cariou. I know I will be met with a lot of disagreement on this however I find that his performance is lackluster as compared to that of George Hearn (the national touring cast and featured on the video recording). George Hearn is first and foremost an actor. He happens to have an amazing voice. Len Cariou is first ...
Ok, maybe ot exactly, but close. This is an astounding musical soundtrack. To make you appriciate the amazing quality of this recording, immediatly after listening to it, I declared it my favorite musical of all-time. The amazing vocal talents of the three leads(Lansbury/Cariou/Garber)are thrilling and compelling to no end. And the sonic quality of the 2CD set is great as well. this one is a keeper! If not for just 3 tracks, &quot;Joanna&quot;(Garber) &quot;Epiphony&quot;(Cariou) and &quot;God that's Good&quot;(Company)
Okay, this is the best Broadway Album ever made. That is saying an incredible amount, but it is absolutely, 100%, true. The sheer ability of Stephen Sondheim is thrilling in and of itself. His interpretation of the story is amazing too
SWEENEY TODD is Sondheim's masterpiece musical. With a very strange plot, this unique musical is great for everyone who wants a daring, brilliant, avant-garde, and fun musical. The musical is ingeniously complex, but still catchy and enjoyable. The book by Hugh Wheeler is wonderfully written and very grandiose. I enjoy musicals more when the story isn't one someone would think would be a good musical. A Tony award winning musical with the famous Angela Lansbury about a man who slashes peoples throats and then disposes them in the most peculiar way is an amusing thought. The musical stars the great Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. Cariou is the tortured, symathetic, yet murderous Sweeney Todd. Unjustly commited by the sick and twisted Judge Turpin, he has come back ...

The item description is Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street 1979 Original Broadway Cast. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: There was a time when I thought of Sondheim as a composer of soppy-sensitive ballads like Send in the Clowns, the sort of thing popular among people trying to pretend they're elegant.<br />Sweeney Todd changed all that. So soon as I heard a couple of bars on the radio (The Tower of Bray), I knew that here was a composer to rival the best that have ever existed. I was already a devotee of Der Freischuetz and Mahagonny, and it seemed that at last America had come of age musically. I rushed to buy the LP set (this was in 1981), and it exceeded my expectations. I had heard about Sweeney on my mother's knee, along with Faustus and Dick Whittington, so I had some idea what to expect.<br />Over the years, I learned every word by heart - much to the consternation of the neighbours, who thought it dreadfully perverted. And yet, Sweeney Todd is a morality play; only ironically does it call itself a melodrama, you don't have chorus-commentaries in melodrama. I have acted in a morality play myself (Death in the Tree, Hans Sachs, 1555), and Sweeney follows the same formula (only it is a thousand times more imaginative). The cast rams home thee message at the end by pointing into the audience and singing &quot;Isn't that Sweeny there beside you?&quot;<br />Sondheim is able to make us care all the characters, even the loathsome judge; at his most perverted (Johanna,Johanna), he is also at his most pitiable and vulnerable.<br />If you like this work, I suggest you check out the movie &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;. It's quite similar underneath its surface differences, and has some great music.
