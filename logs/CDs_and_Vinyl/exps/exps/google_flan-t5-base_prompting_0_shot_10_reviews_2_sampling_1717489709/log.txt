Sino | What can you say about a lady with such a powerful and yet delicate voice who can still keep it up after so many decades on the stage? And Mercedes Sosa is a native American i.e. &quot;Indian&quot;, it's rare that someone from that background succeds as much as Mercedes has done.<br />And she's proud of it! One song on this album, &quot;Cinco Siglos Igual&quot; chronicles the destuction of the Americas in the 500 since Columbus, but does so in an elliptical, poetic, moving fashion.<br />This particular album is pure pleasure and fascination, never a dull song. She belts out the definitive rendition of &quot;La Ultima Curda&quot;(The Last Binge), and the orchestra really takes you along for the ride; the song compares the churning of a drunkard's innards ...
Sin & Soul...And Then Some | My musical tastes are mostly classical, but Brown is of such calibre that he easily fits in with Shostakovich, Beethoven, Weber, the great composers. Each song has the ability to take you into a separate complete universe...&quot;heaven and hell&quot;.<br /> I reckon that Brown is America's greatest living vocalist.
Britten: Les Illuminations op. 18 / Serenade op. 31 | The &quot;Serenade&quot; has to be Britten's most compressed and dramatic work; all the force of his greatest operas is distilled into a few minutes. Listen to the opening horn-solo;in just a few seconds, it establishes the otherworldly atmosphere that prevails throughout the work. It is scored for the natural horn,and its rough, dark tones bring out the qualities perfectly. ....The Serenade was written in 1942, and you can hear the Blitz as an undertone to almost every note. Yet it is overtly just a nocturnal, a piece about the approach of night, with poems drawn the finest of five centuries of English literature. The &quot;Dirge&quot; is such a tour-de-force that it might cause us to overlook the other pieces, but this would be a mistake. The wonderful ...

The typical musical has you leaving the theater humming catchy tunes and a feel good outlook on life. In Sondheim's &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; (which is really an opera) a listener or theater-goer leaves the theater moved, frightened, laughing, and yet questioning goodness in human nature!<br />I got to see this musical on Broadway, with this particular cast, and have never seen anything quite like it since. Len Cariou, Angela Lansbury and the rest of this exquisite cast created a comical, romantic freak show in which the good guy did not always come out on top. If you do not know this show, it would be good to find out more about it before you buy it. My email address is listed in my &quot;about me&quot; page. I would ...
Stephen Sondheim has now earned the title of &quot;Master of the Macabre Musical&quot; in my book for composing this remarkable piece. With stories of revenge, murder, love, and (literally)man-made pies. Sondheim is the only man I know who could make a musical about London's most notorious homicidal pair. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and his accomplice Nellie Lovett, into an unique, and melodic masterpiece. I couldn't picture anyone else accomplishing such a task. Sondheim simply shows that, if done correctly you can turn anything into a musical masterpiece.<br /> The story begins with our protagonist (forcefully played by Len Cariou) arriving back in London after spending fifteen years in Bedlam, when his wife and child were stolen from him by corrupt Judge Turpin. He ...
Inspired by old British folklore and a melodramatic play about a murderous barber whose neighbor bakes his victims into meat pies, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; is not only a true musical thriller, a blood chilling piece of theater, but the very best score composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim has given us to date. Set against the back drop of industrial revloution London, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; tells the tale of Benjamin Barker, a good man sent to prison by a lecherous Judge Turpin who covets Barker's wife, Lucy. As the musical begins, Barker has escaped prison, assumed the name Sweeney Todd, and returns to London with revenge in his heart and a need to find his wife, Lucy, and their daughter, Johanna. Todd turns to Mrs. Lovett, his pie baking neighbor from his ...
strictly speaking,from a musical standpoint(i.e.composer not tunesmith)The art of the american musical(or opera)has three fountain-head landmarks,that have any shot at immortality.a holy trinity, and in this order.gershwin's porgy and bess,sondheim's SWEENEY TODD,and bernstein's(and sondheim's)west side story.Period.
When, as a teen, I sat down to watch this cast in the London production of Sondheim's hit in 1980, I had little idea of how blown away I'd be. The next couple of hours were a revelation. &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; was popular theatre, but it was operatic, with gorgeously constructed songs. It was escapist melodrama, but it was also scathing social commentary. It was excruciatingly funny at times, and at others so wrenching and elegiac I wept, and so did the two teen-aged guys with me! It threw me into an uproar, and I burned to know: who writes stuff like this? And who the heck is Stephen Sondheim?<br />&quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; maintains such a rabid following principally because the songwriting is so masterful. Nobody manipulates mood quite ...
I'm glad I took the advice of the other reviewers and purchased this full soundtrack album rather than the highlights. Only being familiar with the televised production of this bizarre and wonderful musical, I was intrigued to hear several pieces that were cut from the televised release. (Warning though. . .the Judge's ode to Johanna is really twisted, I won't describe it, you just got to listen and you'll get the point) My only disappointment is that there is no recording of this work with George Hearn who stared in the television version. He adds a hysterical mania to his performance, especially in the frightful &quot;Epiphany&quot; which is riveting and lacking in Len Cariou's far more subdued presentation. If you can find a video copy, by all ...
To say that this recording isn't amazing would be ridiculous. Sondheim's lyric and tonal skills are unmatched in the current Broadway scene. With a mix of severe atonality and dissonance coupled with beautifully crafted melodic lines this musical borders on operatic qualification. This musical is something that anyone will love...even me, a 19 year old. The only flaw I can find in this recording is the performance of Len Cariou. I know I will be met with a lot of disagreement on this however I find that his performance is lackluster as compared to that of George Hearn (the national touring cast and featured on the video recording). George Hearn is first and foremost an actor. He happens to have an amazing voice. Len Cariou is first ...
Ok, maybe ot exactly, but close. This is an astounding musical soundtrack. To make you appriciate the amazing quality of this recording, immediatly after listening to it, I declared it my favorite musical of all-time. The amazing vocal talents of the three leads(Lansbury/Cariou/Garber)are thrilling and compelling to no end. And the sonic quality of the 2CD set is great as well. this one is a keeper! If not for just 3 tracks, &quot;Joanna&quot;(Garber) &quot;Epiphony&quot;(Cariou) and &quot;God that's Good&quot;(Company)
Okay, this is the best Broadway Album ever made. That is saying an incredible amount, but it is absolutely, 100%, true. The sheer ability of Stephen Sondheim is thrilling in and of itself. His interpretation of the story is amazing too
SWEENEY TODD is Sondheim's masterpiece musical. With a very strange plot, this unique musical is great for everyone who wants a daring, brilliant, avant-garde, and fun musical. The musical is ingeniously complex, but still catchy and enjoyable. The book by Hugh Wheeler is wonderfully written and very grandiose. I enjoy musicals more when the story isn't one someone would think would be a good musical. A Tony award winning musical with the famous Angela Lansbury about a man who slashes peoples throats and then disposes them in the most peculiar way is an amusing thought. The musical stars the great Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. Cariou is the tortured, symathetic, yet murderous Sweeney Todd. Unjustly commited by the sick and twisted Judge Turpin, he has come back ...

Target: There was a time when I thought of Sondheim as a composer of soppy-sensitive ballads like Send in the Clowns, the sort of thing popular among people trying to pretend they're elegant.<br />Sweeney Todd changed all that. So soon as I heard a couple of bars on the radio (The Tower of Bray), I knew that here was a composer to rival the best that have ever existed. I was already a devotee of Der Freischuetz and Mahagonny, and it seemed that at last America had come of age musically. I rushed to buy the LP set (this was in 1981), and it exceeded my expectations. I had heard about Sweeney on my mother's knee, along with Faustus and Dick Whittington, so I had some idea what to expect.<br />Over the years, I learned every word by heart - much to the consternation of the neighbours, who thought it dreadfully perverted. And yet, Sweeney Todd is a morality play; only ironically does it call itself a melodrama, you don't have chorus-commentaries in melodrama. I have acted in a morality play myself (Death in the Tree, Hans Sachs, 1555), and Sweeney follows the same formula (only it is a thousand times more imaginative). The cast rams home thee message at the end by pointing into the audience and singing &quot;Isn't that Sweeny there beside you?&quot;<br />Sondheim is able to make us care all the characters, even the loathsome judge; at his most perverted (Johanna,Johanna), he is also at his most pitiable and vulnerable.<br />If you like this work, I suggest you check out the movie &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;. It's quite similar underneath its surface differences, and has some great music.

This woman is so talented and I've loved hearing her sing ever since she first appeard on the British version of the talent show.
She's more relaxed and past having to repeat songs she did on the show. This album has great voice and sound!
Very nice quality sound, CD!!<br />Great music.. happy to have treated my loved ones with<br />this product.<br />Would buy again... thanks,

I like Susan Boyle and this album didn't disappoint. Bought two extra copies and gave them away as gifts to delighted recipients
The woman can really sing and did not falter this time. Well worth the time and coin!
Love, love, love this cd & Susan Boyle Such a varied selection & love the duets especially with Donny Osmond. His talent compliment Susan's. Great match-up
I usually like to give positive reviews. That said, I'm afraid that there was nothing on this c.d. that was more than mudane. I am very disappointed. I so cheered for her when she was a sensation on Britain's Got Talent. She had this air that anything was possible and you could conquer all odds when the world was against you. I admired her for that. But this, oh I don't know, is just not what I expected. Most of these songs are slow ballads and I was just waiting for her to mix it up, throw in some uptempo songs. However, it seems she is only capable of giving you the same song - only slightly reimagined.<br /><br />I am hoping that her next c.d. will ...

Lift a Sail | Bought this as a gift, and he loved it.
Synthesis | Great CD

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Although a slightly different style from their previous albums, Evanescence has brought another great album to the scene. While the album as a whole is definitely different from their other albums (namely Fallen), this one has a similar feel and relative style (meaning the songs to the other songs in the album) that Fallen had. I highly recommend this for anyone that likes Evanescence, Lacuna Coil or any other band of that style.
I love this CD! I also got fast delivery with this order and I am very satisfied with my purchase.
You guys have to be prepared with this album. I know a lot of Evanescence fans can't wait to purchase this cd, rip it open and let your ears pick up the blissful paradise that is Evanescence. Heck, I expected that too. It didn't happen though. Some first thoughts might be that there are not too many mainstream songs on this album. Some of these songs you might even hate on first listen. Being a huge fan of all of their previous work (Before Fallen as well), I was severely dissapointed in this album. But being the Evanescence fan that I am. I gave it a second chance, and then a third. Still didn't help. But suddenly I would start humming certain verses in my head randomly ...
When I first bought this item, I selected to have it delivered to my house in 2 days (for a little extra charge). It didn't arrive in time for me to give it to my sister on her birthday. It came 7 days LATE!! What's worse, they still charged me the extra fee even though it didn't show up the day they said it would. Poor service, poor delivery. Very disappointed.
Sadly I was really looking forward to this album, how one group could go from "Fallen" to this heap of manure is really suprising. First of all this isn't a gothic album, heck its not even a rock album. You could easily place Christina Aguilera's picture on the front of this CD and sell it as her latest work without any problems.<br /><br /> If youre a fan of pop (Britney Spears, Aguilera, Ashley Simpson etc) then try listening to a sample of it, otherwise if you have a decent taste in music steer clear of this.
Awesome album!! I'm still waiting for my copy to arrive, but I've listened to the album several times on the internet. The sound of the new album is still very Evanescence, but also different and unique. Evanescence's uniqueness amongst a pop driven world, is what initially drew me to Fallen and this album has even more of that without going completely overboard. My favorite songs on the CD are Lose Control, Sweet Sacrifice and Lacrymosa. But all the songs are really very good, definitely worth the wait!!
To be perfectly honest, the first time I listened to this CD I wasn't all that impressed. There just seemed to be something missing. Something was different. But the more I listened to this disk, the more I came to like it.<br /><br />I'll admit, I was a little biased before I even took the wrapper off this CD. There was the whole "Ben wasn't a part of this album" thing in play coupled with a few pretty negative reviews on here, and the high expectations (Fallen set the bar pretty hight). Don't get me wrong, this disk is not quite as great as Fallen, but it more than holds it's own once you get into it.<br /><br />I knew I was hooked when I realized that ...
One of the best I have ever heard. Unfortunately I just discovered Evanescence more than a decade after they began their work. Best songs: Lithium, The Only One, Snow White Queen. Others very good too.<br /><br />Evanescence is now my favorite. Unfortunately their early CDs are not available unless you get luck and $400 on ebay. I am trying to get them all.
I'll go song-by-song.<br /><br />Sweet Sacrifice - I love the FU-type sarcasm in this first song. It's a very powerful and fun song to start the album with. I've heard comments that this album is overproduced, but the overprouductiveness definately works for this song. I think it will probably be one of the singles.<br /><br />Call Me When You're Sober - This song is very catchy, which is why it was a good first single to start with. Not one of my favorites on the album, but very good nonetheless.<br /><br />Weight of the World - Another song that could possibly turn into a single. I like it; it's simple, compared to the rest of the album. It's still heavy, though. The lyrics are cool, and the ...

I had been wanting to order this CD for some time and I finally saw it for a great price. He's one of my favorite artist looking forward to ordering more of his music.
A well represented repertoire of Kenny Lattimore's best recordings and as well a few new ones. Kenny is a great singer with a unique style still present in the shadows of great ballad singers such as the late Donny Hathaway and Luther Vandross. Stay true to your calling Kenny.<br /><br />G. Lee
It arrived on time and all my favorites songs were listed. This CD had the songs for a wedding; Great timing.
I enjoy listening to Kenny Latimore. However, there is one particular song that I really wanted to her...song number six if you know what I mean. It holds alot of memories for me.
This is the best complilation of songs by Kenny Lattimore on one CD. It contains cuts from his early albums as well as some of his later soul ballads. This is a great economical way to experience Lattimore's singing talents and music style.-- It is simply... THE BEST!!!
can Kenny Lattimore allow his greatest hits cd be released without If I Lose My Woman on it? That's definitely one of his best songs so why is it not included on this cd? I was ready to buy it until I noticed that. I have all his other cd's so I'm just gonna pass on this one.
It is a beautiful album. Kenny Lattimore has a great voice, and the lyrics and melodies are very romantic.
Love Kenny Lattimore. Bought this CD because it had one very special song on it which my husband and I used for our first dance at our wedding. However, all the other songs are just as beautiful.
HE IS ONE OF THE BEST ARTISTS IN THE BUSINESS. THE BUST OF KENNY LATTIMORE CD IS GREAT. I LOVE IT.
Absolutely!!! This cd is a winner in my book.

10 Years Solo Live | This album is astonishing, just astonishing. I could go on and on about Mehldau's technique, his extraordinary ability to improvise, the beautiful sound he coaxes out of the piano, and the pristine sound of the CDs. All of which would be true. But what makes this collection so breathtaking is the sheer profundity of Mehldau's playing. It's like one is experiencing a poem.<br /><br />Several years ago, I had the privilege of attending a solo Mehldau concert at what was then called the Neurosciences Institute concert hall (a hall with sound so wonderful Mehldau once said it was one of only three places he would play without amplification). He played without intermission, and when he was done, many stayed to process the concert. We all understood that ...
Thanks for the Dance | With this posthumous recording, Leonard Cohen proves that he belongs to that exceedingly small group of artists who maintained their originality and creativity until the end. Beethoven, Michaelangelo, Matisse, Shakespeare, and very few others. If the melodies are quite as original as earlier works, the poetry is as cutting and as profound as almost anything Cohen has written.<br /><br />"Thanks for the Dance" is a worthy epitaph.
Mutations | I admit that while I have liked Vijay Iyer's previous albums, I never really loved them. They were good, but not stratospherically good. &#34;Mutations,&#34; on the other hand, is a phenomenal effort. Others are better placed than I to give the technical details, but I can say that this music explodes the boundaries between contemporary classical and jazz, between acoustic and electronic. In a very real sense, this music cannot be labelled, which makes listening to it so rewarding. In a sense, the music explores the same territory as Brad Mehldau's &#34;Highway Rider&#34; (which I also cannot recommend highly enough), but they go in very different directions. In short, buy this CD. It's amazing.
Which Way Is East | This double CD is less a collection of Lloyd's music and more an epitaph of his long friendship with the late Billy Higgins (or as Lloyd often called him, "Master" Higgins). The music itself is all over the place (literally), African, Middle Eastern, free jazz, blues, and all points in between or beyond. Both musicians play all sorts of instruments, and Lloyd plays a lot on alto rather than tenor. But unlike Lloyd's earlier CDs on ECM (every single one of which is masterpiece), this CD is more episodic, less intricately worked out. Individually, each piece is worthwhile. Collectively, the sum is marginally less than its parts. But that being said, what ECM presents here is a record of a friendship, a private converstation made public, and ...
Ambient 1:Music For Airports | I remember reading a long time ago that Eno meant for this music to be unobtrusive enough for the background, but complex enough to reward close listening. Recently, I needed to finish writing a new conclusion to a forthcoming book, and I needed something that would be both interesting and quiet to help me write (silence almost always doesn't work for me), so I returned to Eno's "Music for Airports." And it worked perfectly. It's a fascinating experiment, and hypnotically beautiful.
Anima Sacra | I read about Jakob Orlinski in The New Yorker, and immediately went to amazon to purchase the CD. It look a little longer than usual to get to me, but the wait was more than worth it. All of the music on this CD has been sitting in an archive somewhere for the last few hundred years, and it is just spectacularly beautiful. Truly, it's become one of my favorite CDs.
Le Vent | This CD continues in the same vein as the trio's previous outing on ECM, Rruga, and some might consider that a drawback. On the other hand, this music is so beautiful and the sound so pristine (as usual for ECM) that it would be very hard to complain. What I like most about this music, and I'd include the recent CDs by Tord Gustavsen, Vijay Iyer and Brad Mehldau, is the way they extend jazz vocabulary into new and uncharted territory. The last thing one would say after listening to this CD is that you have heard this kind of thing before. The music is original, it's profound, and it's wonderful. Buy this CD. You will not regret it.
Live! | Many years ago, when I was in high school, I won this album in a contest by a local jazz dj, and it has accompanied me through the next 45 years or so of my life. It's an utterly perfect set of music, and Angel Eyes is one of the most beautiful I've heard. Like Jim Hall himself, this albums is a classic. If you don't have it, buy it now.
The 1971 Fillmore East Recordings | I've been listening to this CD on Spotify, and I can assure anyone considering the purchase that this is 6 CD's of pure bliss. Duane left us far too early, and so several hours more of him at his peak would surely be enough to justify this package. But there is more, much more. I had no idea that the Allmans had numerous guests, and I was amazed to hear a soprano sax on several cuts. So in the middle of "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed," it's like Steve Grossman, Miles Davis' sax man at the time, walks on stage and starts wailing. It's fascinating to hear the different versions of the same tunes on different nights. Often, the solos are completely new, but more than once, ...
The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings | I was at the Montreal Rolling Thunder Review concert, and without a doubt it was one of the two best rock concerts I've had the pleasure of attending (the other was The Who, 1975, Quadrophrenia Tour). I remember that "Isis" practically had the Forum exploding, it was that intense. So it was with considerable anticipation that I looked forward to hearing it again, after lo so many years. Amazing to say, it's as good as I remember it. Better even. The other cuts are also astonishing. By this point, Dylan and his band had achieved a perfect balance between precision and raggedness, and Dylan's voice has never sounded better. As you might expect, the rehearsal tracks are much less intense, and Dylan's voice, oddly, is higher than ...

Target: This will be a short review because I haven't finished listening to this CD, but it is absolutely fantastic, and so is the sound. While Brad Mehldau is terrific, the real star of this CD (from what I've heard) is Joshua Redman, whose creativity just beggars the imagination.<br /><br />Buy it. This is clearly one of the best recordings of the year, if not longer!

Output: Anima Sacra as a bonus.

A Little More Personal Raw | WOW! I am amazed that there are so many good reviews here. They must be planted by her die hard fans and friends/family members. This cd is awful- her voice is bland- and she has no vocal range whatsoever. She sounds like every other teeny bopper wanttobe musician today- she is overproduced and has no real talent. When I saw her perform at the american music awards- I was convinced that my opinion of her is correct. She is horrible live- and is way too cocky for my taste- especially when she does not have the talent to back it up. While I put her above the nasally untalented britney spears-- she is no Kelly clarkston or carrie underwood. This album is a D-.
Some Hearts | This is a fanatastic album! Very impressed with her vocals and range- especially in Before he Cheats and Jesus takes the Wheel. Well worth buying this cd. She is going to go far.

In case anyone was wondering what someone who has never voted on American Idol feels about this Dual Disc here it is....I really love it! I did watch the last episode of Idol as I do every year as I know I will be hearing and seeing these people all over the tv and radio. I loved Bo's voice on Idol and I am happy to say it is well represented on here also. Way to go Bo! Great songs and a wonderful voice makes for a very enjoyable dual disc!!
bo bice's debut cd is amazing.he has such a pure soulful voice.it is a fun cd.this cd is great.bo is a star and he will be around for years to come.get the cd and hear it four your self youll absolutely love it!
This is a winner from start to finish, with not one single weak track in the entire lineup. Every single song is totally listenable. You're Everything, Hold on to Me, and the incredibly beautiful Valley of Angels are among my favorites. For Bo fans, the Dual Disc is a must-have because of the bonus tracks which he wrote and performs with his own band SugarMoney; the songs are pure, vintage southern rock Bo. I've been lucky enough to hear advance copies of most of the songs, and they've been on my CD player for weeks now. They just grow on you, the more you play them. A great CD.

The item description is The Real Thing. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I was so excited to listen to this cd- as I loved Bo on American Idol. But this cd shows what he is really made of- and emphasizes his true southern rock influences. Valley of Angels is the best song in my opinion- but there is not a bad song on the cd. Bo is going to go far- he really has what it takes. :)

Output: Great songs and a wonderful voice makes for a very enjoyable dual disc

I've listened to this about a dozen times already and I keep digging it more each time. One of the first things I noticed is the rather short times on many songs - between 2:30 and 3:30 for the most part, conjuring up memories of the records of old. That may explain why this album has been so easy to listen to. It seems this is a bit more pop oriented, although Herb does get in some brief jazz solos here and there.<br /><br />"Chattanooga" starts things off in a bit of a techno sound. "Blue Moon" has a bit of the Colors feel to it to start before breaking into a light swing on the bridge. Some nice horn work towards the end of the tune. ...
A magical listen
Herb; Thanks for continuing to show the world how to make a great record.
Herb continues in the jazz genre, and most of the songs are &#34;standards&#34;, well-performed by this talented artist and his excellent backup musicians. Maybe not his best, but certainly worth having, if you're a Herb Alpert fan.
I learned about this album listening to a most satisfying interview of Herb Alpert on Watercolors on Sirius Xm. I was already quite delighted listening to this wonderful, talented man talk about his art and its development, but nothing could have prepared me for the thrill from hearing a CD sampler they played--Let It Be Me. The rendition is so fresh it made me feel I was listening to the decades old song for the first time. The harp accompaniment helps accomplish that. Needless to say, I ordered In The Mood the same day. The rest of the CD is outstanding!
Good arrangements, good to hear Herb again after all these years.
Alpert has been around for a long time. Still enjoy his music. Good choice.
This is a fantastic album! We've had a number of guests over and all heads were nodding in agreement. Wonderful. Herb's still one of my favorite trumpeters. And when it comes to taste and original ideas, he still nails it every time. I'm also a fan of his albums with Lani Hall.
Upbeat and just what you would expect from Herb. One of my favorites in a long line of Herb Alpert CDs. I do wish his wife would stay out of it, her days of singing are pretty much a thing of the past, but its nice to make it a family affair. Nice job Herb:)
GREAT CD - described perfectly and arrived on time. Very happy with this purchase.

All the Best | This is an excellent list of songs on a CD for Paul's work after the Beatles. I only wish it had "Too Many People" from the Ram album on it. But other than that, this is a keeper for the collection.
Tango In The Night | I am writing this review for those of you that are into Vinyl records to get that nostalgic vinyl sound from the 80's. First of all, if you like Fleetwood Mac, most likely you will like this album. However, my review not on the songs, which by the way I really like, but on the out standing recording and mixing done on this album. I have an original master recording from the 80's of another Fleetwood Mac album that does not sound any where near as good as this. If you have a turntable, and like clear, soft, smooth, sounding highs that you can only get from vinyl, this album is a must. The stereo separation and the effects, will want you to play this over and ...
Bloodrock 2 | I grew up in the 70's and 80's and kept thinking the song cheater I remember as a kid. I could not get that song out of my mind. I looked to buy the CD at a store but could not find it anywhere. Hence, I tried Amazon, and there it was. However, I forgot what the rest of the songs were like. When I received the disc, it was like listening to all those songs like the first time again. I love this CD. If you like underground music that has very little radio play but is excellent music, then this is a great CD for the collection.
Live in Concert | I use to own this vinyl copy when I was 12. I was excited to get this music back. The sound quality on the live album is a B, but the songs are an A. Time flies by so fast when listening to these songs, especially while driving. The only song I think is dragged out is lost woman. I wish it was cut in half. The solos become a bit too long and too much to listen to. Other than that, a GREAT CHOICE, at a great price.
Rio Grande Mud | I almost passed on buying this CD due to the negative reviews I read. However, I saw a great sale and bought it anyway in June of 2012. I am glad I did. My copy sounds great for such an old recording. The songs are just how I remembered them on vinyl. And I think this is the best Album ZZ top ever made. Here is my take. If you see it for a good price, go for it. Maybe there are different versions made. My CD recording is just fine. I am so happy with this CD. It is a must if you are a ZZ Top fan.
Wishbone Four | This is my all time favorite classic rock album from Wishbone Ash. I used to own it in vinyl. Note the recording sound back then was not too hot, even on the record. Hence, you have to make some tone adjustments. However I really like the songs and I am able to adjust the tone to make it sound good.
Thirds Remastered | I grew up in the 70's and remember a few songs from this album being played on an 8 track in a friend's car. I had an urge to get back some of those songs so I bought the CD. After hearing all of the songs again, I feel this is the best album they ever did. There is a variety of tunes and I recommend this to any Joe Walsh fan. The best part about this is I feel each band member contributed equally to the success. Joe Walsh does not do all of the singing, although I like his singing very much. The songs I did not like as a kid, I now enjoy as an adult! Great buy!
Stranger In Town | This is definitely one of Bob's best albums ever. It is rarely that I like every song, and this album does just that. The recording is very good as well, which is a plus if you like good sounding albums.
Yer' Album Remastered | I bought this cd for Funk 48. However, I ended up liking the entire cd. If you are a James Gang Joe Walsh fan, most likely you will not regret this classic album. Great songs to the core!
Best of Volume 1 | I was never a big Van Halen fan, but always like a few songs here and there. I must admit, after buying this CD, I am hooked. Every song is good, and I like the recording sound quality as well. Thisn is a perfect addition if you don't have any of their albums.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I stopped believing for a while until this album came. Journey would be proud.....I'm believin' again. One of the best.
All the songs I love. The vinyl is also high quality. This is the thicker vinyl records that are less likely to warp. Only complaint is I seem to have gotten a bad record. Side 1 is cut wrong and the first song jumps everywhere. Second song had a scratch on it somehow. And finally, the needle never seems to go to the end of the album. Amazon is great with exchanges though so it's a non-issue.
Quick delivery, awesome product, way beyond my expectations. Came with a high quality cover and heavy duty plastic sleeves for the records. Great product for a great price.
Purchased this on vinyl and once it arrived I ripped it open and played through. It sounds SO great on vinyl. I appreciate the heavy weight and the obvious time and care that went into the quality remastering job. If it were just for the album and the vinyl pressing, this would be a 5 star review.<br /><br />Since record players dont work well in cars or while exercising, I was also looking forward to owning the digital copy that was advertised to come with the album. BE WARNED!!! The digital copy that comes with the album expired Dec 31, 2012. The most mind numbingly frustrating part is that it does not state that anywhere on the packaging. It simply states "Free Digital Download of complete album". ...
wonderful album
This is a great record for anyone to have, the songs are still as good today as they were when they first came out. The record plays great and it was a quick delivery.
What's not to love about Journey's Greatest Hits on vinyl! Was my favorite band in the '80's and I still love them today.
good teens music
great!
Great album!!! You can't go wrong with Journey

The item description is Greatest Hits. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: The songs are great but if you are buying this vinyl for superb sound don't waste your money.  The only thing that sounds extra clear are the vocals and the guitar.  The recording on the drums and bass are muddy and not defined on several songs.  Yes the songs are great buster hits and sound good on middle of the road stereos.  But if you are serious about sound, buy something that has a much better master recording of all instruments.  The better your stereo, the worse it will sound.  I am seriously disappointed as I received it as a Christmas gift.for Christmas.  My guess is that the original mix did not have high enough quality to get this to sound any better. This does not reflect the songs themselves, but rather the poor mixing job done when it was recorded. After listening to all the songs longer, there are a few recordings that sound better with better bass and drums but overall it will sound better at lower to mid volumes.  On very good recordings you can really crank them up and it does not seem to bother your ears.  I play this album at the 10 o'clock position and do not consider going to the 12 o'clock position for I feel it will be harsh on my ears.  Too bad they are great songs with just a mediocre sound.  However, they did do a nice job on the vocals and the 180 gram record is very nice.  It almost reminds me of a 78 record.

Grave New World | This is one of Strawbs' finest moments, with great songwriting, great arrangements and superb perfomances all round. From the spiritual uplift of &quot;Benedictus&quot; to the acoustic simplicity of &quot;Hey Little Man...Thursday's Child&quot; and on to the riches deeper into the album (particularly the powerful &quot;New World&quot;), this music is pure joy. Dave Cousin's haunting vocals drift in and out beautifully. John Ford gives an impressive &quot;Beatle-like&quot; performance on &quot;Heavy Disguise&quot; and there's lots more to enjoy and cherish here. This is a GREAT album!
Relayer | This is a superb album and one which has stood the test of time. The first track, the epic "Gates of Delirium", is one of the best pieces of music ever produced by Yes. It is simply awesome. The musicianship on this album is amazing and the music itself is a heady amalgam of rock and jazz. This will not be the most accessible album for some, but perseverence will pay off! This was another album which the critics hated and the fans loved - sorry critics, but the fans know best! This is a classic.
Led Zeppelin | Reviewer: dlusher from London United Kingdom<br /><br />This is simply an amazing release - it is everything DVD was tailored to do and the subject matter is important if you are interested at all in rock music. The sound is superb and the films are awesome. If you want to know why this band was so important and influential, and why they ruled the rock world, then buy this DVD, play it, gape and listen. I'll admit to being a Zeppelin fan (since the early 1970s), but it is to my great regret that I never saw them live. I've seen Plant & Page. I've actually met both gentlemen and they are fascinating people, but this DVD has filled an important gap in my life. Thank you ...
Cream - Royal Albert Hall - London May 2-3-5-6 2005 | This DVD provides some welcome relief to the thousands of fans who were unable to attend these comeback gigs. The concert does not disappoint and the quality of this double DVD is superb.<br /><br />It's a great set - every song is a classic and the musicianship is simply fantastic. When playing, Bruce, Baker and Clapton seem to enjoy a telepathic connection at times. Bruce and Baker may look old, but they sure deliver the goods - bigtime! It's amazing to learn that some of the songs had never been played by Cream in concert previously (e.g. Badge). All 3 musicians give good, interesting interviews and there are alternate takes of some of the songs.<br /><br />Highlights: N.S.U., Rollin' and Tumblin', We're Going Wrong, Toad, and Stormy ...
Acoustic Strawbs: Baroque & Roll | This album features acoustic reworkings of some Strawbs classics performed by Dave Cousins, Dave Lambert and Brian Willoughby. The musicianship is just exquisite, with close harmonies and really good arrangements that work well. Highlights include &quot;Tears and Pavan&quot;, &quot;Down By The Sea&quot; and &quot;Benedictus&quot;. But there is not a weak track on this album and the whole project hangs together well. These guys can really write, sing and perform.
Close to the Edge | This was the album that confirmed Yes as a supergroup. 'The Yes Album' and 'Fragile' had broken important new ground, but 'Close to the Edge' was the beginning of a period where the band would create sonic soundscapes that bewildered the rock critics of the day, but thrilled the fans. I remember the first time I heard this - I was in a record shop and the helpful chap behind the counter played it for me through headphones. The music blew me away from the beginning - I just could not believe what I was hearing. The title track was just amazing, and then came 'And You and I' and I was stunned! I bought the record immediately, rushed home and played it to death. I can ...
Spirit of Autumn Past | This album is full of pleasant surprises, particularly the song &quot;Evergreen&quot; which has a wonderful arrangement and soaring guitar solos to die for. The whole album is a really interesting experience - the music is fresh, the songwriting first class, the musicianship wonderful. I can't recommend this band highly enough - their music is so infectious - a mixture of folk, Pink Floyd, and other wonderful progressive references. This album will have you feeling VERY pleased with yourself at having had the good sense to buy it!
A Nod and a Wink | Camel have been around for quite a while and their last album "Rajaz" was excellent, but this new release is so much better. It evokes England in a way that has not been done for many years (perhaps since "Selling England By The Pound" by Genesis). The guitar work on this album is exquisite and all the songs are superb. A real return to form for Camel. This album is dedicated to the late Pete Bardens - it's a wonderful compliment. The last track "For Today" is really lovely and has a terrific guitar solo that is worthy of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour. I just love this album.
Tales from Topographic Oceans | This album was years ahead of its time and perhaps the closest Yes got to creating a prog rock symphony in four movements. The critics didn't like it much, but most of the fans did. The debate about the music still goes on, so the best thing to do is buy it, listen to it, and make up your own mind. Yes still play sections of this album in their live set and this is always well received. It was a brave and ambitious thing to deliver such a musical statement to the listening public in the 1970s, but Yes had the balls and first-class musicianship to do just that. It was never going to be easy to top 'Close to the Edge' or 'Fragile', but this ...
Argus | This is Wishbone Ash's finest moment - it's a wonderful album that takes you through a range of textures and emotions. The guitar work is just superb with tightly woven instrumental harmonies and really interesting songs. This is a rock album you can listen to over and over again and not get tired of it. Both the electric and acoustic guitar playing is first class - &quot;Warrior&quot; followed by &quot;Throw Down The Sword&quot; still knocks me out every time I hear them and I've been playing them since the 1970s! &quot;Argus&quot; is Wishbone's masterpiece...

It's been released in Brazil, and here in Brazil we have a saying that says : "if you have the cheese and the knife in your hands, you've got all you need to make a sandwich". What I mean is : if Yes has got so many good songs, why provide us with 38 minutes of music ? And guess what ? The bonus brings more 25 minutes of talking. It is Rick Wakeman talking about the making of the Acoustic Yes. Didn't we have enough of talking in Yesspeak (the DVD we buy thinking it's a concert and it is not)? I only give three stars to this DVD still because of Yesspeak. This DVD is a continuation of Yesspeak, but with lot more music. I'm ...
Before you start throwing tomatoes (or should I say, used copies of "Tormatos") at the "Unhelpful" button, I am a Yes fan, so just relax. The music and performances on this disc are magnificent. What little there is. A shamefully deceptive marketing ploy lies at the heart of my "1-star" rating. On the package, the "running time" of the DVD is listed as "65 minutes". There is no other qualification offered, which would give most unsuspecting marks (oh, excuse me, I mean Yes fans) the impression that you are getting at least a one-hour set of music. Here is what the man behind the curtain is actually offering: a 38-minute concert. And if you subtract the first five minutes, an uninspired, meandering soundcheck jam (listed as "Tiger ...
I've been waiting for years for a Yes concert video whose sonic presentation was on par with their music and their skills. All too often their DVD releases fall short in the audio department compared to the better releases. But finally on this one the audio quality gives us everything we want to hear: Jon's wonderful vocals, Rick's clean dexterity on keyboards, Steve's amazing guitar work, and Chris' bass are all cleanly rendered and easily accessable to the listener (sorry Allen; there just wasn't much percussion to reference in this regard).<br /><br />The only thing I wish for would be more of it! I saw the last tour and the acoustic set was one of the highlights. The guys should consider rearranging many of their classics in ...
I agree that this DVD is too short but it's a video of the actual Jan. 26th 2004 show which was only 38 minutes long and adding unnecessary fill would have taken away from a performance that really was/is excellent. I'd much rather have thirty-eight minutes of this than a couple hrs. of meandering, overblown, grandiose self indulgent... it's been done too many times already.<br /><br />This DVD shows a side of Yes that makes me (an old Yes fan) feel really good. First of all they all look great and genuinely seem to be enjoying this rather than just going through the motions. What I mean is the performance doesn't come across as at all stale. They not only all look good but the music is ...
my problem is this<br /><br />even though yes is getting old<br /><br />jon's voice is still great<br /><br />the playing is great and unique as always<br /><br />nobody plays like these guys<br /><br />they have such genius in arranging things<br /><br />they are all professionals<br /><br />they did not reherse but when the time came<br /><br />it was good wasn't it?<br /><br />you forget what music they did<br /><br />you people do it better<br /><br />if yes would release the next close to the edge<br /><br />people will be trying to bash them again saying it's<br /><br />too much like close to the edge but you people forget the standards<br /><br />so keep it down and don't bash them just go listen to something else
To all who may have the seen the BIG tour for '04 - the acoustic set was a bore. The rest of the show really rocked. This DVD is just like the show , only worse. The banter between the Yes guys was totally scripted and they said the same little jokes every night and it's the same on this DVD. This DVD is only for the most DIE-HARD Yes fan (thought I was). I'm sure you can find one cheap on Ebay.
This is one of those frequent cases where you want to pay for a jewel, a tiny one, but an authentic gem at last.<br /><br />Never ever had we recordings of an "unplugged" Yes. BTW, dunno why they purposefully disregarded this very fashion term to refer to acoustic concerts. A few songs conformed this show, but all of them in a smooth delicate manner of feeling the music. A gem that deserves a place in any Yes collection.
Although,as previously mentioned, a short performance-it is lovely,and shows how the band is, still today,sounding marvellous.Perhaps the best thing about this DVD is the rehearsal footage with absolutely hilarious narration from Rick Wakeman,who is a truly funny fellow, as well as one of the finest keyboard players ever.As are the rest of the band,in their respective specialties.Messr's Howe,Anderson,White,Squire & Wakeman have been performing as good as, or better than ever on tour recently-and the acoustic sets have been a considerable highlight.If you have missed these shows,then this is a great way to see just what the Masters Of 70's Prog have been up to lately-and it IS wonderful to see just how vital they still are,all these many years later.Highly recommended to Yesfans...and to anyone who appreciates ...
Back in 1975,at the Q.R.P. concert (ASIN: B00005Y7NP), Yes played with Patrick Moraz on keyboards,acoustic versions of "I've seen All Good People"; a strange but interesting version of "Long Distance Runaround" and the classics "Mood For A Day"/"The Clap"; making of these, a great good asset in their performances at the time. Now Yes offers some re-makes of their old hits spanding their sound with good fresh versions of "Roundabout" and "South Side Of The Sky" but it's a shame that this last song didn't include the middle part with those fantastic choruses (La,la,la,lai,la,la...). After saw it, the first question is: Why didn't appear songs like "Onward", "And You & I" or "The Ancient" that are good songs for this kind of acoustic setting?...<br />By the other ...
This is a very good DVD revealing a new side of Yes music - their old hits gain new life in acoustic version. The sound is a bit unusual for this group - it has warm jazzy feel, and is very natural. No distortion devices are used, and one can hear the real sound of the instruments. All components of the DVD are exceptional: video, audio mix, design/menus and special features: rehearsal footage narrated by Rick.<br /><br />The only drawback is the concert being too short, but it was the limitation of satellite transmission.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed every minute of this show.

Wakeman is brilliant; Anderson's vocals continue to be a revelation; Howe remains a guitar genius; Squire and White play as one (with Squire even managing to maintain that unique "lead-bass guitar" style on an acoustic bass!<br /><br />Superb sound quality - fun for all the family. It even has candles...

Output: Close to the Edge'.

Ev'rybody Know Me Explicit Lyrics | The YoungBloodz have kept themselves in the game the last six years by showcasing their own talents to the fullest. "U-Way" and "85" on 1999's Against Da Grain provided a little blip on the hip-hop map, but the Lil-Jon produced "Damn" on 2003's Drankin' Patnaz was a stellar hit that made people pay attention to the rapping duo. It was enough to get them their first Gold album and remain on the roster at La Face Records. Fast forward to today, and the release of Ev'rybody Know Me provides some decent material, but still doesn't have the huge appeal that many other southern rappers have managed to attract.<br /><br />But it's not from a lack of trying by any means. The YoungBloodz represent for the A-town on ...
Smooth Sailing | Maysa has been one of those artist who has been constantly looked over when you go to the store and look in the music racks. Yes, she's the artist who you'd typically say "I've never heard of her" and yet you probably have heard her. She was once the female vocalist in the jazz fusion group Incognito. She was the voice behind songs like "Deep Waters" and "Still A Friend Of Mine" for all you jazz listeners out there. She has had four solo albums, the first three being the self-titled album Maysa, All My Life, and Out Of The Blue respectively. Now she returns with another jazz-influenced album entitled Smooth Sailing.<br /><br />The first single from the album is the title track "Smooth Sailing," a good ...
Hip Hop Violinist | Miri Ben Ari is probably the hottest hip hop element of the last five years. She has been featured on so much stuff, you probably couldn't count it all. Most recently she was featured on almost all of Kanye West's "College Dropout." If you ever heard a violin in the background, nine times out of ten it was probably the work of Miri Ben Ari. Originally from Israel, Miri has been able to mesh well with the hip-hop sound using her string instrument of choice. Before she made it big, she was looked at as a novelty of sorts. But Miri is trying to make a name for herself, and the name that she chose was The Hip-Hop Violinist, which happens to be the same name she ...
Some Kinda... | There seems to be a little bit of overcrowding in the R&B realm lately. With all these artists and more coming on the scene, everybody is trying to fight for that consumer dollar that ultimately determines the longevity of their musical careers. Whether you are a long-time veteran or the newest discovery, the bottom line is album sales for the most part. Nobody wishes this was the case, but that's the harsh reality of living in a capitalist society. Whether it's movies, music, sitcoms, or novelists, there is a certain level of success that you must maintain to keep the higher-ups happy. Dwele must have mustered enough buzz and sales from his first major release Subject in 2003 that Virgin gave him another go with his latest ...
Love & Life | Deemed by Simon Cowell as the one to beat when she was on American Idol, this songstress captured the hearts of millions as she sung every song she belted out. When she was voted out prematurely, the viewing audience as well as the judges were in utter disbelief. She had done so much to get to that stage in her career where the world could witness her giving the other contestants a run for their money. Being a part of a band and traveling the world prior to the whole American Idol thing, she got the experience she needed to prepare her for future success. Having proved her vocal abilities to anyone who witnessed her singing on the show, Latoya London easily inked a deal with Peak ...
Right About Now | Whether it was with Black Star or Reflection Eternal, Talib Kweli represented to the fullest. Getting praise as high as Jay-Z on The Black Album, Kweli is more than just your "favorite rapper's favorite rapper." He has a pretty solid underground and mainstream career despite the amount of album sales any of his projects have sold. His first solo effort Quality was satisfactory, but didn't match the success he had as a member of Black Star or Reflection Eternal. He revamped his approach entirely on The Beautiful Struggle by capturing a few A-listers in the industry to give his album a more commercial appeal. That move probably hurt a lot of his underground fans that he has held onto over the course of his career. Now Talib ...
Jermaine Dupri Presents Young Fly & Flashy 1 / Various Explicit Lyrics | Jermaine Dupri deserves a lot of kudos for staying in the game this long. He's managed to build a career that patterns itself after nobody not to mention landing Janet Jackson when others couldn't. That says a lot about a person who used to be a dancer trying to break into the business any way possible. Nobody could have imagined a more distinguished way of establishing a multi-million dollar franchise like he did with So So Def or being Executive V.P. of one of the top music labels in the business. He's launched the careers of Kris Kross, Da Brat, Xscape, and many others with his all-or-nothing attitude. Don't get me wrong...he has some sidesteps from time to time (any album by the Da Brat after Funkdafied, ...
Bobby Valentino | "Blackberry Molasses" is one of those one-hit wonders that few people actually have in their music collections. It was a hit for the R&B group Mista on the radio in 1996, but it probably did little for the members as far as money, power, and respect. Fast forward nearly 10 years later and out comes Bobby Valentino from the group Mista making moves on his own. The truth of the matter is that Mista had a second album under super-producer Timbaland that never materialized due to management issues, so Bobby Valentino ultimately went on to college and earn a degree at Clark Atlanta University. But music was still in his blood, and Bobby Valentino was itching to jump back into the music biz and take another shot ...
Gold | Finally, a New Edition collection that gives a nice selection of major hits and dynamic album tracks all on two discs. There have been quite a few single disc compilations over the years, but none as comprehensive as this latest release. We all know the group had plenty of jams as well as a bunch of solo hits that we want to listen to as well. Classic gems from early in their career include "Lost In Love," "Count Me Out," "Mr. Telephone Man," and "Cool It Now." A few album tracks from then sneak on this double disc as well, namely "Earth Angel," "My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet)," "With You All The Way," and "A Little Bit Of Love (Is All It Takes)." The middle years brought ...
Best of Pete Rock & Cl Smooth: Good Life | Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth never had a lot of commercial success, but one thing can be said about them: they stayed true to the game. Putting out quality material throughout the 90s, the duo epitomized the sound of East Coast music for many hip-hop heads. Putting out classics like "They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)," "I Got A Love," "Lots Of Lovin'" "Take You There," "Mecca And The Soul Brother," "One In A Million," and "Straighten It Out," The Best of Pete Rock and C. L. Smooth delivers both the commercially-released hits and the album track gems that most of their fans have come to love. Many die hard fans already have everything on this disc. But for those youngsters who are just learning about the group, ...

"3121" gets five stars only from those who are paid by the record label to write bogus reviews." - Actually Jason, those who rate this album five stars are the ones who have good taste in music. Shows how much you know (which is nothing). Next time, when you write a review, try to put some thought into it. Don't just write words for the sake of writing them to show your mom you actually learned something in grade school.
I am beyond surprised by how much fun this cd is! Even the few songs about religion are positive, funky and fun! I think it's very clever how Prince has found new ways to write lyrics that are sexy and sultry without being perverse.<br /><br />To Joshua Hubeny, the "long-time Prince fan" that said Prince hated electronic music...perhaps you should spin some of those classic albums a few more times and listen to the songs "Dirty Mind", "Annie Christian", "AUTOmatic", "Computer Blue", "U Got the Look", "Shockadelica", "The Future", "Live 4 Love", "I Wanna Melt with U", "LOOSE", "New World" & "Strange but True". Prince built his career by pioneering the use of synths and drum machines in R&B. He may have thrown out the drum machines ...
Great comeback! After the commercial success of Musicology, witch I didn't love that much, he's back with a great album.<br /><br />3121 - 9<br /><br />Lolita - 9<br /><br />Te Amo Corazon - 10<br /><br />Black Sweat - 9.5<br /><br />Incense and Candles - 9<br /><br />Love - 10<br /><br />Satisfied - 9.5<br /><br />Fury - 8<br /><br />The Word - 10<br /><br />Beautiful, Loved & Blessed - 10<br /><br />The Dance - 10<br /><br />Get On The Boat - 10
Ok I bought this on a whim. I hadn't heard any of the track but I was like hey it's Prince. I am so glad that I did. This CD is like that. It flows from beginning to end and it gets your head bobbin'. From the beats you can tell how talented Prince. I could just listen to the instrumental version of the CD You can listen to it over and over again. The tracks I like the most are Black Sweat, Incense and Candles, Beautiful, Loved & Blessed, and The Dance. I definitely recommend this CD.
It seems that a lot of Prince fans think that every new album is weak if it isn't as good as Sign of the Times. Well, not to be unkind, but Prince is never going to make an album as good as Sign of the Times again. His days of revolutionizing music are over. However, his days of making good music are certainly not, if his last two releases are any indication. Musicology was an immensely enjoyable, if safe, soul album. With 3121, Prince goes in another direction (although just as safe) and gives us another very solid effort.<br /><br />Laden with synthesizers, vocal effects and funky guitar licks, 3121 recalls the early 80s Prince sound that Musicology never even brushes up against. Not that it sounds ...
Thank you for the God-given gifts that U continue to give to us...Thank you Prince...this album is the absolute BOMB!<br /><br />Standout Tracks:<br /><br />Black Sweat<br /><br />Incense and Candles<br /><br />Love<br /><br />Fury<br /><br />The Word<br /><br />The Dance
As a new Prince fan, I am proud to be apart of this new Prince album era. This is an absolutely brilliant album.<br /><br />Prince experiments with great and futuristic sounds. The beats are addicting and groovy.<br /><br />Great party album... I hope he has a successful year.<br /><br />This is by far Prince's best album since Around the World In A Day! Not to mention it is slated to be his first No. 1 Billboard debut since 1985!<br /><br />GOOD JOB PRINCE!<br /><br />THIS IS A MUST BY FOR 2006!
I give it five stars: it's not perfect, but it's so good it still deserves top grade.<br />The packinging is indulgent - it's Prince after all! His home decor is, shall we say, a little on the "velvety" side, but at least he puts his lyrics next to all the pix. The "Willy Wonka gold ticket" on the wrapping is just plain cruel though - seven people get a chance to win the chance to see him play - at his house I guess. Needless to say, there was no ticket inside my copy. And: I spent $25 on signing up for membership on his NPG website - how dumb can you be, LOL. Annoying website, leading you through a maze of options: it gets real tired, ...
3121 is Prince's best effort in years. He sounds great vocally. I think all the musicians playing on this album sound very good too. My favorite track is Beautiful Loved and Blessed. This is a song about how the person you are in love with makes you feel. Tamar Braxton shines singing with Prince on this track. I think she has such a pretty voice. I also loved the tracks Te Amo Corazon and The Dance. These are very romantic songs with a very sensual feel to them. Black Sweat and Get On The Boat are two songs that will get you moving. Black Sweat doesn't make me sweat, but I really liked the funky beat to it. I think Fury is another standout track on this ...
So... Tammy La Gorce, amazon.com editorial reviewer, believes Prince to be "the black Beck." What a ridiculous statement. Nothing against Beck, but his first album came out in, what - 1994? A decade-and-a-half after Prince began recording, heavily influencing so many artists (Beck included). I guess B.B. King must be the black Eric Clapton?<br /><br />That said, this new Prince release is actually far less interesting than the last couple Beck releases. It's okay, I guess, but really has very little memorable music. I'm often called an "honorary woman of color" due to my tireless efforts to promote equality among the races. Even so, I've been called an ofay many times in my life (I always turn the other cheek). I also used to work in the ...

Target: Talk about a man that has nothing to prove.  He didn't seek to set trends, keep other artists on their toes, or lay the blueprint for having a long-term career.  All of those things were the result of Prince's one main goal in life....make good music.  Some may argue that Prince has had his fair share of weak albums.  But don't dare try to tell that to the multitude of die hard fans out that that continue to buy EVERY album and sell out countless concerts almost 30 years since his emergence into the music industry.  After building momentum with his last couple releases, Prince mixes all of his styles together and pushes further away from the norm with his new album 3121.<br /><br />Critiquing a Prince album is just as delicate a procedure as reviewing other limitless artists like Outkast and Miles Davis.  For example, Prince jams out on the funk-infused "Love," but then he does a 180-degree turn on the very next track with the sultry and equally melodious slow jam "Satisfied."  The title track "3121" is about as far-reaching and varied as Prince has ever been. With a synthesized voice layered over his regular tone coupled with a techno-laced funk groove and live instrumentation, this is arguably a sample of what the future of music will be.  He continues along those same lines with "Lolita" but focuses on lyrics more than he does on "3121."<br /><br />Those wanting more distinguishing sounds from Prince will find their fix of slow songs with "Incense and Candles" and "The Dance" as well as the up tempo jams like "Black Sweat" and "The Fury."  "Te Amo Corazon" gives a little Latin flair to his traditional smooth sounds, "Get On The Boat" is another funked out party cut, and "Beautiful, Loved and Blessed" is a radio-friendly cut sung with his prot?g? Ta'Mar.  If this isn't proof that Prince is back better than ever, I don't know what is.  3121 is unwavering, refreshing, and a clear statement to all that ever doubted Prince's ability to maintain relevant in an ever-changing music landscape.

Output: Talib Kweli is more than just a singer

THE LEGACY, the debut of TESTAMENT is a complete THRASH masterpiece from the late 80's!!!!! The sound is completely RAW and THRASH, Chuck Billy scream like a insane Hetfield and all the stuff turns into a BRUTAL METAL insanity!!!!!!! GREAT DEBUT!!!!!but, PLEASE....THIS NEED TO BE REMASTERED!!!!!!
The first album from Testament showed everybody exactly what these guys were going to be bringing to the table. As a Bay Area thrash band, they had expectations to live up to, as Metallica and Exodus had already hit the scene and gained major recognition, not to mention Slayer and Megadeth in L.A. Testament proved they had what it took to measure up, and had major potential to be a force in the thrash genre.<br /><br />"The Legacy" features some of the band's classic tunes, like "Over the Wall," "The Haunting," "Burnt Offerings," "First Strike Is Deadly," and "Apocalyptic City." I also love "Raging Waters" and "Curse of the Legions of Death." The speed, shredding, soloing, and all-around talent on "The Legacy" made Testament an instant contender ...
&#34;The Legacy&#34; which is the 1987 debut album from Bay Area thrash legends Testament is an album that is nothing short of pure thrash metal awesomeness. I've had this beast of an album in my CD collection since I first bought it at the age of 18 back in 2002, so needless to say, I really wish I would've reviewed it on here back in the day sooner. I've always found Testament to be one of the best and most underrated thrash metal bands, and while they've never been as well known as other thrash giants such as Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax, and of course Metallica, it sure doesn't take anything away from their musicianship, and believe me, the musicianship here possessed by the guys in Testament is ...
Testament's debate album is nothing short of awesome, raw as hell, fast, thrashy, and full of rage, I don't care if Testament are kind of known, obscure bands usually suck, anyways, this debate of the bay area thrashers rules, the production kind of sucks, but doesn't sound too bad, could use a remastering though, still, the music kicks A$$, Chuck Billy's vocals aren't his best on this album, but they certainly aren't bad, some of the lyrics were written by Steve Souza (Exodus), for those who don't know, before Testament was Testament, they were known as The Legacy in about 1983, and Steve Souza was the original vocalist, but he got called to Exodus, another killer bay area Thrash band, and no Testament are not a christian ...
this album is just great. Testament is an extreemly underrated thrash metal band that everyone should listen to. "Burnt Offerings" is the best song, but "Over the Wall", "Raging Waters", "First Strike Is Deadly", and "Apoctolyptic City" are amazing too. All the songs are good though. If you like metal you must get this album.
Until very recently, I was never familiar w/ Testament. Someone recommended them to me. I must say that this and &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot; are their best albums, by far. The music is very much like that of 80s MetallicA which rules, because old MetallicA rules. The best tracks are &quot;Over The Wall&quot;, &quot;C.O.T.L.O.D.&quot;, &quot;Alone In The Dark&quot;, and &quot;The Haunting&quot;.
TESTAMENT is one of the best HEAVY/THRASH METAL bands of all time!!!! THE LEGACY, their debut is a THRASH METAL MASTERPIECE...ALONE IN THE DARK, FIRST STRIKE IS DEADLY, THE HAUNTING, RAGING WATERS...All the songs are pure THRASH!!! in the most raw and genuine way!!!! One of the best debuts ever, and one of the best from TESTAMENT!!!! REALLY GREAT!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!
Alex Skolnick (lead Guitarist of Testament 1987-1992) has to be the most talented guitarists of Thrash Metal. He went on later to do Jazz guitar...no easy feat. Simply put, Skolnick is the Eddie Van Halen of Thrash guitar. Anyway...<br />This album is as good if not better than Megadeth's &quot;Peace Sells but who's buying?&quot;, Metallica's &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, Slayer's &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, and Anthrax's &quot;Among the Living&quot; -the other four Thrash Albums that dominated at the time.<br />The guitar work of Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson is unmatched. Their intro's are &quot;Bach-Rock&quot; like -that means they place synmphonyesque stuff on their guitars. Fear not, they fuse this feature in with their heavy metal riffs so it is still harsh.<br />Chuck Billy (the vocalist) is also one of ...
the beginning of testament and a great debut album.if you dont have this album you will be disgust by many fans and you have no right to be a thrash fan if you dont have this album!.this is all awesome kick in the face thrash metal!!.tracks like over the wall,the haunting,first strike is deadly,do or die,and alone in the dark are so brutal!!.theres LOTS of beutiful guitar work,awesome vocals,and dark lyrics.everything about this album is hardcore.so my final words dont be a poser like listening to nu-metal and all that kinds of crap,so if you wanna be a true metalhead,get this and it will possibly change your days as a poser forever my dear friend.
This is as fast and heavy as ****. A brilliant debut album from a very young bunch of musicians. The production in some parts are a little chaotic, but the music makes up for this plenty. Stick it in the car with your Mother in Law in the back and play it load!

Chick Corea appeared the formal opening of Tokyo Yomiuri Hall in this June. The first three days he performed solo piano play and next three days as a Hot House Tour with Gary Burton and Harlem Strings Quartet. The proceeding of his solo at that night I heard was quite similar with this CD. He played “Pastime Paradise” and “The Yellow Nimbus” together with songs by Evans, Monk and Chopin. “Pastime Paradise” seems to break fresh ground for Chick. Its fairy tale like introduction and film music like ending sounds fresh to me. In “The Yellow Nimbus,” he reproduces the whole world created by the trio with Paco and Don Alias at the ’82 Touchstone album. “Pannonica” is played shorter than the ’94 GRP’s Expressions version. He ...
out on a world tour, chick corea is further expanding his large resume of a lifetime love with the piano. i was fortunate to see him, live, just last month as he was embarking on the very beginning of this tour, and bought this cd at the show. as was the case with his previous cd titled "improvisations/ childrens songs" , this cd is not only a great representation of what he is doing live right now, but also gives a great look at his musical interests in 2014. a large and varied assortment of solo piano titles including some of his children's songs and, what he calls "portraits". he will invite people one by one up on the stage, and has them sit with him and ...
At this stage in his career, Chick's playing is absolutely wondrous. His delight in creating music is evident in this collection of musical &#34;portraits.&#34; While in the past I've sometimes felt that Chick's technical expertise and fluidity became ends in themselves, in this collection he lets his technique serve the music, which at times left me breathless. I especially enjoyed his take on Stevie Wonder's &#34;Pastime Paradise.&#34; In the past few years Chick has been playing The Beatles' &#34;Eleanor Rigby&#34; and it's great to hear him continue to explore pop music here. Also, the piano was recorded with a warm, pleasing sound; a welcome contrast with the tinny sound of Corea's Expressions CD, for example. All in all, a masterful, playful and &#34;deep&#34; set of performances from ...

The 20/20 Experience | Excellent music from a talented singer and performer. I enjoyed every song on this CD which is remarkable as usually you like a few songs but not every song. This is an exceptional musical experience. Love it.
Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 and 2 | Classic Ronstadt songs. I have the albums, now I have the CD's to listen to in the car. Excellent purchase.
A Head Full of Dreams | I'm a Coldplay fan and I am enjoying listening to this CD on the road these days. Excellent purchase.
Rufusized | Excellent purchase. Just as smooth and soulful as I remember. Rufus and Chaka Khan is classic R&B music to listen to while driving in the car with the wind in your hair. Love it!
A Jazzy Wonderland | I purchased this CD to replace my cassette tape of this album. It's a jazz arrangement of traditional Christmas songs from jazz artists Wynton, Branford, Ellis and Delefeayo Marsalis, Harry Connick Jr., Nancy Wilson, Tony Bennett, Grover Washington Jr., Kirk Whallum, Terrance Blanchard and others. I particularly like listening to this music while driving in the car during the Christmas season. Excellent purchase. Jazz and Christmas carols had a baby and the product is this enjoyable album.
The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac | Excellent purchase. I am enjoying all of the classic Fleetwood Mac hits. Just listening to Stevie Nicks is a nostalgic blast from the past.
Christmas Collection: 20th Century Masters | This is one of my favorite Christmas albums due to Vanessa Williams's clear, melodious voice. I Wonder as I Wander is a personal favorite. This CD is a mix of traditional arrangements and soulful, jazz renditions of classic Christmas songs. Excellent purchase.
The Little Drummer Boy | I purchased this CD out of pure nostalgia. This was THE Christmas album in our house growing up. My late mother had this album and the cover art is what I remember most. It had the little drummer boy with a Dutch Boy haircut, dressed in a blue tunic with red tights, standing in the snow on a dark, cold winter's night. The background of the cover art was midnight blue. I hoped the CD would have the same cover art, but alas, it does not. However, the music is the same, traditional Christmas songs sung by an impeccable chorale. Growing up, this old Christmas chestnut was taken out once a year and played on Mom's swanky 60's stereo. We'd listen to it as we decorated the ...
Chaka Khan - Chaka | Love classic soul music and Chaka Khan is a favorite R&B artist. An excellent purchase that I will enjoy over and over.
Christmas Guitar | I bought this CD to replace my cassette tape of this album. This is a melodious rendition of 26 Christmas carols on guitar by John Fahey. Perfect to listen to while drinking cocoa by the fireplace, getting into the Christmas spirit while wrapping presents, or while baking Christmas cookies with the kids. Turn off the tv and tune into this wonderful album.

Artist Dimthingshineon recently did a cover of David Bowie songs: "She Shook Me Cold", "All The Young Dudes", and "Something In The Air" on his latest 4 CD project called "Nostalgia" released in 2009. Check out [...]<br />or [...]
Previously issued as three separate discs, this set covers Bowie's career through 1987. This ignores the last 20 years, in which Bowie released eight albums.<br /><br />If you're a casual fan, the 2-disc "Best of Bowie" is a better bet. It includes all the hits and features selections from the later albums such as "Tin Machine", "Outside", and "Hours".<br /><br />The four disc box set "Sound and Vision" covers the whole of Bowie's career (so far) but leaves off "Fame" and "Let's Dance", while including two or three rarities.<br /><br />This leaves "The Platinum Collection" squarely in the middle. All the hits are here, although many of them are radio edits, which may be jarring if you're used to the full-length cuts. (The edit on "Young Americans" ...
There is nothing bad that I can say about David Bowie.<br />If anything, about this platinum collection, they are missing a lot, but it is still a good compilation. :)
Timeless music, a must have for any road trip. A gem of American culture and a sound that will take you away. Fast shipment, reliable seller.
I'm a massive David Bowie fan and this collection is a great addition to my own collection
Clasic
David Bowie deserves to be recognized as one of popular music's most effective songwriters. Beautiful melodies are pervasive in his music whether the genre is rock, punk, glam, or soul. His songs sound fresh today, even though many we're written over 40 years ago. Some annoyances on this collection:<br /> - No "Panic in Detroit," one of rock's greatest head-bangers.<br /> - Bizarre (AM radio?) rendition of "Young Americans."<br /> - Short version of "Heroes." A longer version of this masterpiece could have been included.<br /> - Some filler on each CD.<br />But these drawbacks don't significantly detract from an otherwise excellent collection.
We ordered this collection as a Christmas gift for my step-son's girlfriend. It arrived on time and in the condition advertised. She loved it.
This set is great. If you like Bowie's music but don't know where to start with his albums, this is the answer to your prayers. It features all the well-known radio songs, plus a lot of great music you probably haven't heard. I bought it three days ago and haven't stopped listening to it since.
The Platinum Collection collects 58 of Bowie's most beloved recordings<br /><br />Pluses:<br /><br />- everything is remastered<br /><br />- most of Bowie's essential hits are here<br /><br />- a few rarities that are only available on the very expensive "Sound And Vision" box<br /><br />- unlike "Sound And Vision", contains the hits as well<br /><br />Minuses:<br /><br />- I am fine with radio edits sometimes, because some are needed to save space, but... why do we get the heavily edited "Heroes" (one of Bowie's finest hours) yet 7 minutes of "John I'm Only Dancing Again", which is one of the worst disco forays ever.<br /><br />- the idea that 1987 was the end of Bowie's career is kinda presented here. Any true Bowie fan knows that the ...

Love In Stereo | I stumbled over Rahsaan Patterson's first album a couple of years ago when I thought the cover looked interesting. I was rewarded with a great honest r'n'b album and eagerly awaited his follow-up. It doesn't disappoint. While it doesn't have any of the fantastic string arrangements that were a highlight of the first album, it's probably a bit tighter and funkier overall. And while it is steeped in traditional r'n'b, the album avoids an obvious retro feel. Here's an album full of strong songs, well played and well sung. Unfortunately that's not what's fashionable in what passes for r'n'b these days and that, coupled with his record company's apparent unwillingness to promote him, means that Rahsaan Patterson doesn't sell anywhere near the numbers he deserves to.

with a voice like gladys knight's, one could sing from the telephone directory and sound meaningful, but that's not good enough for knight whose made it her mission to expose listeners to music that touches the soul. much like natalie cole, knight feels that there is something missing from today's music an endeavors to transport fans to a time &quot;when there were blue lights in the basement&quot;; unlike cole, knight attempts to fill that void by combining original compositions with covers. the songs on _just for you_ deal directly and deeply with issues such as racism-&quot;guilty&quot;, &quot;choice of colors&quot;-and heartache-&quot;next time&quot;, &quot;i don't want to know&quot; . additionally, &quot;i'll fall in love if you hang around&quot; and &quot;somehow&quot; reflect knights emotional and vocal range, reaffirming her membership ...
Most of the CD's nine tracks are winners; I should have picked this up years ago. My favorites include &quot;Next Time&quot; (nice, medium-tempo groove) and &quot;I Don't Want To Know&quot; (fierce vocal really grabbed me after a couple of minutes; GK is warning her straying hubby not to look back). The &quot;End Of The Road Medley&quot; is a bit long and reminds me of the lukewarm &quot;Way We Were/Try To Remember&quot; medley from long ago; however, Gladys' voice makes up for it. Especially when she soars into &quot;If You Don't Know Me By Now&quot; and &quot;End Of The Road.&quot; My absolute favorite entry here is the remake of &quot;Choice Of Colors.&quot; It's a perfect song anyway, and Gladys pours herself into this version. I wish MCA could ...
There are some very good songs here like, Next Time, Choice of Colors, Guilty, and I don't Want to Know. The live, End of the Road medley may be a little overdrawn, but the soulful intensity of the last few soaring minutes make up for it. The other songs range from decent to maudlin. That being said Gladys Knight is one of the best soul singers around. She can make even the most mediocre song worth hearing. The same was said of Aretha, her voice was worth hearing, regardless of the song. Gladys Knight can wring so much emotion out of a song. Listen to her range of emotion in the song, I Don't Want to Know, going from betrayal and hurt to resolve and strength; or ...

The item description is Just for You. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: After the disppointment that was Good Woman, one of the truly greatest voices in contemporary music got it all together on this gem and released one of the greatest soul albums of the 90s. With sympathetic production,  especially from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Gladys purrs and growls in her gorgeous rich alto and sings with a passion that can lift your spirit or have you bawling your eyes out. There is not one weak track on here and the End of the Road medley could go on and on forever as far as I'm concerned but why oh why was that stupid monologue tacked onto the very end? What comes before is just so sublime, though, that this still gets five stars.

Here are some examples of user reviews for other items, in the format item description | review:
Close to the Edge | Out of the three YES albums (THE YES ALBUM, FRAGILE, and CLOSE TO THE EDGE) I have heard on someone's stereo, this captures the best music that is not heard on their previous albums. More importantly, RICK WAKEMAN who joined for the FRAGILE record plays an extremely wide variety of keyboards on every song on this album. His HAMMOND organ sounds a whole lot better than original keyboard player TONY KAYE; furthermore, RICK'S mellotron that is heard on the whole album definitely gives YES' music a more powerful and psychodelic sound for this album. The title track is my most favorite song on this album. The first two segments (the highlight for me) of this song are outstanding with STEVE HOWE'S guitar ( including the SITAR guitar) ...
Hat Trick | This is not my favorite AMERICA album because I feel that it does not match up to the arrangements of the other four AMERICA albums form 1972-1975. On the other hand, I do not want to discourage anybody from buying this for themselves because it is a classic that definitely is worth listening to in its own right, especially for the classic AMERICA fans. More importantly, there are good songs on here, and my favorite songs on this album are GERRY BECKLEY'S piano ballad GOODBYE with the harmony vocals, the synthesizer, acoustic and electric guitar riffs , and his acoustic ballad SUBMARINE LADIES with the vocals, harmonica, and the orchestra. Plus, his piano ballad SHE GONNA LET YOU DOWN with the harmony vocals, electric guitar solo, and ...
David Gilmour | When I bought this vhs tape in 1991 at the beginning of my senior year, I heard the best concert performance by DAVID GILMOUR that even outdid the DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER tour, despite that keyboard player Gregg Dechart used a KORG organ instead of the HAMMOND B5 organ. Furthermore, it also outdoes the PULSE tour that fortunately includes a complete live performance of THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. The highlight of his solo band in my musical opinion was and still is BAD COMPANY'S lead guitarist MICK RALPHS whose guitar playing style gave DAVID's music a whole lot more guitar rock power than TIM WENRICK from the PINK FLOYD tours. On the other hand, everybody else in this band were also excellent musicians who should ...
Manassas | This is some of the best music that STEPHEN STILLS has ever recorded, along with the second MANASSAS album DOWN THE ROAD, after the breakup of CROSBY STILLS NASH AND YOUNG. I played these 2 cds and STEPHEN STILLS LIVE for a friend (almost 20 years older than me) several years ago. He told me that listening to these albums brought back a lot of college memories and how he saw this group play all of this album in its entirely in concert, featuring STEPHEN playing a bango on BLUES MAN. Half of this album has excellent tunes; however, the remainder sounds like a STEPHEN STILLS solo album instead of a group recording. Most of THE RAVEN is an excellent beginning segment. First of all, SONG OF ...
Homecoming | My favorite songs on this album are DAN PEEK'S DON'T CROSS THE RIVER (I love to play this song on my 12-string acoustic guitar) with his singing, harmony vocals, the acoustic guitars and banjo, his piano ballad SATURN NIGHTS with excellent harmony vocals, 12 string guitar, and moog synthesizer, the group's arrangement of HEAD AND HEART with the FENDER RHODES piano, acoustic guitar, and all three singers in a solo spot, and GERRY BECKLEY'S piano ballad TO EACH HIS OWN with the moog synthesizer, harmony vocals, acoustic and electric guitars. DEWEY BURNELL'S acoustic ballads CORNWELL BLANK that features excellent lead guitar riffs by DAN and GERRY and MOON SONG with the harmony vocals, acoustic and leslie guitars are excellent. GERRY'S piano ballads TILL THE SUN COMES UP ...
All the Girls in the World Beware | Along with the unpopular &#34;BORN TO DIE&#34; album, this is one of the best albums they recorded with keyboard player CRAIG FROST (this was the second album the CRAIG would write songs with DON and MARK), despite how the cover and title of this album (something I thought DON BREWER might have come up with)is completely silly, if not stupid. Additionally, I thought lyrics to the title track went extremely too far, although the excellent riffs of bass guitar, organ, drums, guitar, and vocals made this song rock out. Anyway, my 2 favorite songs on this album are the broken romance soft-ballads &#34;MEMORIES&#34; and &#34;BAD TIME&#34; that were written and sung by MARK. They feature various keyboards and excellent harmony vocals, but they would have sound better ...
Sleeper Catcher | I borrowed this album from the library when I was 15 and loved it since then. Why this and the other albums are not remastered on cd is a mystery to me. Meanwhile, I was lucky and greatful to find this lp in a pawn shop in great condition for only $1. Then, I recorded it onto cassette to preserve the lp. LADY is a good, but not my favorite song, but I love the radio classic REMANINCING and the other songs, especially the guiet acoustic ballad BEEB BIRTLES' LIGHT IF DAY that features DAVID BRIGGS' low volume guitar solo, excellent harmony vocals, electric piano solo, flute solos, and the orchestra. GLENN SHORROCK'S SHUT DOWN TURN OFF is a outstanding opening song his lead vocal, the guitar ...
Thirds Remastered | This is definitely the best JAMES GANG album of all the 4 albums with JOE WALSH remastered on cd because JIM FOX and DALE PETERS who are also multi-instrumentalists like JOE also sing 1 or 2 songs on this album. Even though WALK AWAY and MIDNIGHT MAN are memorable radio classics, my favorite song is definitely JIM FOX'S "THINGS I COULD BE" with his soulful vocals and organ riffs, JOE's guitar riffs, and DALE'S bass guitar riffs that give this song that excellent psychodelic/blues/rock feeling. When I first heard this song, I remembered hearing this record from the early 1970s. Plus, I also love DALE PETERS' "DREAMING IN THE COUNTRY," featuring his calm vocals, JOE acoustic, electric FENDER TELECASTER, and pedal steel guitar playing, and JIM'S track ...
Caught In The Act | When I first heard this cd in November 2001, it captured the band sounding their best with their revamp instruments and CRAIG FROST'S keyboards that made all their power trio songs sound a whole lot better during their 1975 tour. It's a shame that CRAIG did not reunit with GRAND FUNK RIALROAD for their reunion tour. Furthermore, the songs TNUC, INSIDE LO0KING OUT, AND HEARTBREAKER on this live album that were also on the 1970 LIVE ALBUM and the 1997 BOSNIA album have a whole lot more powerful and better sounding rock and roll power. I wish their orchestra intro that was played on tape was at the beginning of this live album. The organ-driven FOOT STOMPIN' MUSIC is outstanding is the added clavinet by CRAIG and ...
Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends | I strongly believe that this live album represents the best of EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER, who were the second group to release a triple live album, that other EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER greatest hits albums can not match up to. Furthermore, several songs by this power trio that were not my favorites, for example HOEDOWN and the theme TARKUS, sound a whole lot better performed live on this album than on the previous studio albums. KEITH EMERSON'S bass synthesizer (this was sometimes used as a substitute for the piano)and keyboard stills are outstanding, CARL PALMER'S drum playing is heart-pounding, but the sound of GREG LAKE'S clean sounding bass guitar is the best that I ever heard; additionally, it even outdoes the sound of YES'S CHRIS SQUIRE'S RICKENBACKER ...

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
This album represents the loud raw energy of 1972 Yes. Some of these tunes stomp their studio counterparts (&quot;Siberian khatru&quot;, &quot;Perpetual Change&quot;), certain others seem better on the studio renditions- &quot;Close to the edge&quot; is a bit too complex and nuanced to make this version better than the studio one. A lot of people have mentioned a dislike for the &quot;remastered sound&quot; on this cd, perhaps without knowing the original quality of the recordings. While the playing on this album is incredible, the sound is not. &quot;Remastering&quot; can not completely fix a less than stellar recording. Notwithstanding that, I was still not happy with the job Joe Gastwirt did on this release, especially considering the great sound of the YES YEARS box set, which he worked on ...
Wakeman's solo during Starship Trooper is worth the price of admission. And the build up to it... I can't count how many times I've listened to it and I am still amazed. Never fails to bring tears to my eyes.
Giving one star for some vague remembrance of the remarkable original studio recordings of these tracks, which still raise a hair or two for a few seconds when heard on this album, especially "Close to the Edge", and why I thought this album sounded so good on vinyl 30 years ago, which it probably did.<br /><br />Leaves me to the conclusion of a horrible job of remastering, which makes this album barely inaudible at times. It sounds like it was remastered in a dank basement filled with old aluminum pots. Absolutely no depth, bottom or dimension to the music.<br /><br />Your equalizer won't help you here. I took it out of my player twice....just couldn't get through it. It actually hurt.<br /><br />Excuse me, I need to ...
I read the reviews of this product and really hesitated because of the comments about the digital remastering. I was only 9 years old when the album was originally released. My older brother bought it at that time and since we shared a bedroom I was often there when he listened to it. Hence I developed a taste for Yes early on in life. When he married a few years later I ended up buying a copy for myself. Another note: we never had a great stereo system in those days so I never got to experience the LP &quot;to the max&quot; so I can't really compare the quality of the mastering of the LP with the CD. But that said I can say that the CD ...
I didn't think that Yes' supra-complex, textured studio recordings preceding this live set would be translated effectively to the live setting. It's not perfect, but the inadequacies created by the limitations of playing live are part of Yessongs' charm. And while the songs are occasionally missing small ingredients that flesh them out so well on the studio versions, the band's heaving energy more than makes up for it. You can especially hear it in Jon Anderson's singing. His voice is often delicate on studio albums, but here he's surprisingly powerful, singing full-force over his equally lively buddies, who jam with fervor exploding from their instruments. And man, there are lots of jams! Songs are often extended by five minutes or so for soloing, and although many would ...
I've seen yes live at least seven times over their period..<br />Always a show of perfection with the original crew.<br />A few of my good friends and I went to see the movie as we were prog rock enthusiast.<br />The movie was somewhat acceptably at best as far as filming the soundtrack was poorly EQ'd and mixed. since we already seen yes live a few times already this was disappointing.<br />Now for my review, Yessongs vinyl is the best it ever gets and honestly it is just above the actual movie soundtrack best. The CD is worse, sterile and lifeless. One of my favored songs has always bee "And You And I".. The Yesongs version always made my arm hair stand up and made me cry with ...
I would choose this album as one of my desert island disks. That is because Yessongs is a document of a band at the cutting edge of it's era and the peak of it's performing powers. The sheer, almost violent energy that leaps out of these live recordings is a thing of beauty, forever. The material is drawn from the iconic trilogy of albums; &quot;THE YES ALBUM&quot;, &quot;FRAGILE&quot; and &quot;CLOSE TO THE EDGE&quot;. And in most cases the songs are rendered better than the studio versions, particularly &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;, &quot;Perpetual Change&quot;, &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; and &quot;Starship Trooper&quot;. And I should mention the blistering guitar solo Steve Howe unleashes in the middle of &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot;. Sheesh! Those were the days! And Jon Anderson's unique, strong ...
I haven't a penchance for live CDs, I usually feel that they reflect a tired, worn-out artistry which is more for profiteering than for music. However, &quot;Yessongs&quot; is a clear contradiction to this sentiment. The members of Yes play frantically and energetically, and rather than deviating from the studio recordings, they follow them - but not without their own modifications, making it &quot;live.&quot;<br />The clarity of this compact disc is unsurpassed: There is little to be desired of the sound quality, particularly for a live recording. The remastered edition is spectacular, its clarity is excellent: No pops or fuzziness.<br />Yes manages to put together some of their most rambunctious works (Note that I am listening to &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot; off of the first disc as I write this), ...
This was my 2nd Yes record after &quot;Fragile&quot; when I was 11 years old, and I was happy to find it on CD-I literally wore my albums out!<br />One of the great live albums of all time, in fact, I heard Yessongs before I heard the studio versions of many of their songs, and it took some getting used to when I finally heard the studio tracks.<br />You can feel the excitement building during the Stravinsky opening, and then they SLAM you into a smoking Siberian Khatru with that amazing guitar line. The versions of Starship Trooper, Close to the Edge, Yours Is No Disgrace,and And You And I are just wonderful, and Roundabout is a killer too-(Don't forget it was new in 1973!) In fact, all ...
Like the previous reviewer, I also just saw Yes (Anderson, White, Howe and Squire) and I miss Bill Bruford on drums. Just listen to the difference between the live version of &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; and the studio version with Bill. I wonder why Bill plays on 2 of the songs and Alan on the rest??? Nobody does a drum roll like Bruford...

The item description is Yessongs. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: They became the first band to record a triple live album of their concert, and then EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER became the second band to do the same thing.  The purpose that I read, which proves a point, was so all five band members JON ANDERSON, STEVE HOWE, CHRIS SQUIRE, RICK WAKEMAN, and new drummer ALAN WHITE who replaced BILL BRUFORD could be in solo spot on the album.  On the other hand, BILL is also in a solo spot for the drum solo on PERPETUAL CHANGE, so that actually makes six band members.  I can only assume that this song was performed live during the FRAGILE tour and not on the CLOSE TO THE EDGE tour.  However, I would have figured that the medley of LONG DISTANCE RUNAROUND/THE FISH (also featuring BILL on drums and not ALAN) would be performed live during the CLOSE TO THE EDGE tour besides the FRAGILE tour.  One way or another, it is great opportunity for BILL to able to be heard on this live album because it is a plain shame that he left to join KING CRIMSON right after the recording of CLOSE TO THE EDGE (my favorite album by YES).  The intro song (probably played on tape) is a excellent beginner, then comes the intro to SIBERIAN KHATRU that really gets the crowd off their chairs and on their feet with the rhythm and blues guitar intro, and the signature sound of the RICKENBACKER bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and vocals.  However, it is unfortunate that the SITAR guitar was not used on this song.  Next is powerful and louder version of HEART OF THE SUNRISE with the overdriven guitar riffs, louder synthesizer,  where the mellotron sounds better live than on the studio version.  As for PERPETUAL CHANGE, RICK'S tone of the HAMMOND organ throughout the song sounds better than original keyboard player TONY KAYE.  Plus, the mellotron toward the end definitely give this song a more powerful and psychodelic sound that is not heard on the studio version from THE YES ALBUM. Furthermore, the other songs from that album also sound a whole lot better on this live album.  The electric 12-string (replacing the acoustic 12-string guitar) and lap steel guitar sound excellent on AND YOU AND I, and RICK'S mellotron and moog synthesizer sound as refreshing on this live version as on the studio version, although the piano and the HAMMOND B5 organ is unfortunately missing.  The acoustic nylon guitar on MOOD FOR A DAY sounds better live than the studio version, and RICK'S composition of THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII is outstanding with the various keyboards used on this song.  The harpsichord sounds excellent, but the grand STEINWAY piano delivers a more relaxing and breath-taking crystal clear sound that is a rewarding pleasure to hear.  Then comes the low-pitch moog synthesizer solo with the mellotron delivering a choir and orchestra sound in the background; however, RICK should have play the mellotron during the high-pitch moog synth solo toward the end.  Then comes the classic ROUNDABOUT that has an excellent sound, which would have been better if RICK'S HAMMOND organ sounded the same as on the studio version from FRAGILE.  However, the moog synthezer sound excellent on this version, and the high pitch harmony of bass guitarist CHRIS above JON'S lead vocal is outstanding.  On the other hand, I always thought it would be guitarist STEVE singin' the high notes, and I always wondered if either STEVE or CHRIS would sing the high notes or neither would do so.  Plus, the electric guitar that replaces the acoustic guitar sounds excellent.  Now for the second cd, I'VE SEEN ALL GOOD PEOPLE is outstanding with STEVE'S miniature acoustic guitar, the harmony vocals, and RICK'S mellotron, sounding like flutes, in place of TONY KAYE's moog synthesizer on YOUR MOVE and ALL GOOD PEOPLE played at a faster pace with STEVE's blasting guitar riffs, ALAN'S drumming, CHRIS'S bass guitar riffs and RICK'S harpischord.  LONG DISTANCE RUNAROUND that features BILL'S drumming, STEVE'S electrifying guitar riffs, CHRIS'S bass guitar and harmony vocal, amd RICK'S harpsichord is excellent, but not meant to be played at a faster pace.  The sound of CHRIS'S bass guitar on THE FISH is outstanding, but his solo is really dragging the song out.  On the other hand, RICK'S HAMMOND organ and mellotrom are excellent on this song too.  My only complaints about the next song CLOSE TO THE EDGE are the tone of both STEVE'S GIBSON ES345 STEREO and RICK'S organ that do not match the orginal studio sound.  For one thing about STEVE'S guitar, there is no overdrive (like on SIBERIAN KHATRU) on the tone of this guitar (OK for rhythm parts though, but bad for solos), and I do not know if this because of this particalur guitar or the setting of a different amp this guitar was plugged into.  On the other hand, this sound would have been no problem for I'VE SEEN ALL GOOD PEOPLE to capture the original studio guitar sound, but STEVE still should have had this problem looked into.  Meanwhile, the sitar guitar sounds excellent.  As I mentioned before, the last two songs from THE YES ALBUM titled YOURS IS NO DISGRACE and STARSHIP TROOPER have a more power sound than the original studio with RICK'S mellotron.  I love the way that STEVE'S guitar solo sounds in the middle of YOURS IS NO DISGRACE, meaning the overdriven rhythm sound and then the bluesy sound.  J0N'S singin' throughout the album sounds is rewarding to hear.  If there are any songs from the FRAGILE and CLOSE TO THE EDGE tours in 1972 that did not make it on the orginal lp, they should have been added to this reissue edition as bonus tracks.  I recommend this as a must have for all classic YES fans, and I plan to get this on DVD in the future.

Number of the Beast | Iron Maiden's Number Of The Beast released in 1982 is a great metal classic. Featuring the songs Run To The Hills, Hallowed Be Thy Name, Children Of The Damned, The Prisoner, and the title track The Number Of The Beast. 9 epic Maiden songs in total. This is the first Iron Maiden album to feature Bruce Dickinson on vocals.

This is a must own album for any Iron Maiden fan.
The Final Frontier | Iron Maiden's The Final Frontier released in 2010 is a great album featuring 10 Maiden epics. Another great album from Iron Maiden. This album was said to be Maiden's final album when it was released. Thankfully they returned with Book Of Souls that I'll review later.

great 3 dvd set of amon amath. i had this in the past and some how lost one of the dvd's and was only able to find this on amazon
oh hell yeah this is a great and varied dvd set. My favorite band... and lots of different footage. One of the concerts has too much jerky fast editing, flips around real fast. But i wouldn't be without this set! There is footage from several shows. I love it! My friend watches it EVERY time he visits.
What's to say? If you're reading this review you're probably already aware of Amon Amarth. They rock out to songs about vikings, and they do it well. This particular DVD set caters to some of their earlier (and better in my opinion) songs. Excellent live performances which are good for a few views, and multiple listens for when you need some rocking background noise.
I was stupid enough to sell my Amon Amarth - Wrath Of The Norsemen DVDs few years ago but I found it again on Amazon ,used for $5.46 (ridicules how cheap it is!)<br />I was nervous that since I bought it used it would arrive in not so good condition ,but I was wrong!<br />It's perfect and so is this band!<br />I can watch Amon Amarth for hours and that's what I'll do!<br />This DVD has it all from your favorite Vikings! The quality of sound and visuals is just perfect !<br />These guys know how to get your blood pumping! I highly recommend this to any metal-head ,<br />especially if you're into melodic-metal!
Great vid. Great price.
of the "porridge giver" to heap on an extra helping of Amon amarth footage. It is of course a musical journey with creative camera work. It is not a musical visual accomplishment but the rersult of a documentary that's neccessary thing to rock: Ifyou can't be there, you must have this to enjoy: The musicianship is brilliant on the first concerT.The stage is also set as a flaming hall of VAlhalla for the living! A set so exciting and yet there's three shows at least. a documentary as well.They werE waiting for the right time to come out with this..
This is a fantastic DVD! Amon Amarth totally rock, and to have a viking tie-in makes them even cooler. The DVD encompasses several different performances, including a viking battle. It's a must-see!
Amon Amarth are among gods of men and metal. They are definitely a powerhouse not to mess with. This DVD is a whole day of bone crushing metal and awe-inspiring cinematography. I would most definitely recommend this DVD to any fan of Amon Amarth or death metal in general. This DVD is among the greatest you could EVER own!!!
Excelente
