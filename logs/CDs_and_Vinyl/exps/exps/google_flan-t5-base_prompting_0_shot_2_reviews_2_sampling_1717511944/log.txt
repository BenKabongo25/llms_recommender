Kiss Of Death Explicit Lyrics | This is a solid sophmore album from Jadakiss. "Kiss of Death" is probably better than "Kiss Tha Game Goodbye". Kiss became more versatile on this album. He even has a song with Mariah Carey, and it actually sounds good. That's definitely not something you heard on "Kiss Tha Game Goodbye". Some people might not like this album. It's different from what Kiss normally would do. Some parts of the street might ridicule, but it's okay to me. My only huge complaint about this album is the production on some songs. Overall if you are a Kiss fan you shouldn't be dissapointed with "Kiss of Death". Go ahead and cop this!!
God's Son Explicit Lyrics | What else can you say about Nas? In my opinion he ties 2Pac for the best MC in hip hop history! Nas continues to drop quality albums. Even "Nastradamus" was worth buying once you get past "You Owe Me" and "Nastradamus". Who ever says Gay-Z is better than Nas is seriously on drugs or needs mental help. Jay-Z isn't good enough to lick the crust off of Nas's feet. Back to "God's Son", The only really bad song on the album is "Zone Out". Other than that all the other songs are banging. Nas still drops thought provoking lyrics. He is the kind of artist that could be in the industry as long as he likes. This album is capable of 5 Mic status. If only he ...

I love this album! I just bought it again (for the third time) because as soon as someone finds out that I own it...&quot;I'm Jacked&quot; for it. Disregard all his other albums. This is Nas when he was Nasty Nas. This is classic material. My Favorites: &quot;The World is yours&quot;, &quot;One Love&quot;, &quot;It Ain't hard to Tell&quot;, and &quot;Half Time&quot;

The item description is Illmatic Explicit Lyrics. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Best Hip-Hop album of all time!!  Yes, this is better than any 2Pac album ever.  2Pac wasn't even this much of an genius.  This album changed the face of hip-hop forever.  Back when the hip-hop was ran by the east coast, Nas was the only person that took hip hop back to its roots.  He was the best rapper on the east coast, not Biggie.  In my opinion Biggie wasn't even on the same level as Nas.  If Biggie was still alive today he wouldn't be better than Nas.  This ablum literally makes me cry, because I think about how the rap game is today, and it's pathetic.  Illmactic is so ahead of its time.  Just think when have you ever heard an album like this.  I'll help you out, you haven't.  It's been ten years since Illmatic came out, and there still isn't an album like this.  My question is, Will there ever be??  Nas certainly secured his spot as one of the best emcees ever, if not the best ever.  In my opinion if Nas isn't the best ever, then he ties 2Pac for the number 1 spot.  Nas doesn't have to talk about guns, girls, and money.  It seems like he is better than that.  Everyone just follows behind what somebody else does in hip hop today.  If don't believe me just listen to Slick Rick and Biggie.  Slick Rick originizied the art of story telling and Biggie just came behind Slick Rick and did the same thing, he just added violence to his stories.  Also all of Nas's albums sound very different.  You can't say that for any other artists, not even 2Pac himself.  You never know where Nas is coming from.  Perfect example who would've thought that Nas would come out with &quot;If I Ruled The World&quot; after the classic &quot;Illmatic&quot;.  In conclusion &quot;Illmatic&quot; is a must have for any music fan, not just hip hop fan.  If don't have this album, then you are really missing out on the essence of TRUE HIP-HOP!!!

Reasonable Doubt Explicit Lyrics | It's the summer of 1996 and I'm chillin' with a friend of mine and I hear Biggie trading verses w/ a cat who sounds vaguely familiar. The beat had me nodding my head and the lyrics had me mesmerized. Nevertheless, I ran to Best Buy copped what I consider to be one of the greatest hip hop albums of the 90's. I played this album almost everyday for a year and never tired of it. Hats off to Jay Z on this masterpiece!!
Eazy-Duz-It W/5150 Ep Explicit Lyrics | This cd brings back so many memories for me. In 1988, I was 12 years old when this &quot;tape&quot; (remember those) came out and I had no idea the impact this lil' dude and his posse would have on the music world. All I knew was the good music coming through my boom box. Eazy E (R.I.P) was not the greatest rapper, but Dre's beats behind that high pitched voice produced some classics. During that time my family didn't have cable, but we had the Jukebox and I recall running home from school to watch &quot;We Want Eazy!&quot; Those were the days and I was so saddened to see the tragic demise of Eazy E, the Godfather of rap.

Up to 1980 my taste in music was pretty much one sided.. All rock.. When I heard &quot;give it to me baby&quot; it forever changed my world. I actually found out that I could dance. Thank you Rick, keep on funking...

Like the Miles Davis album &quot;Kind of blue,&quot; this recording puts you in a mood that lasts the entire recording. Also, like kind of blue, I know this is a CD I will keep coming back to. Very nice work by Krauss and Frisell and Douglas are amazing together. Anytime you cross Frisell with such inspired compositions and a slide guitar - he comes thru shining. Frisell's playing is so patient - his timing truly unique, hence this wonderful album - lunch for your ears,,,
Let me explain. This disc invokes images and moods, mostly shadows, sunsets, and lonesome highways. It stirs the emotions without overwhelming... conjures a spell reminiscent of those cast by older Fleetwood Mac instrumentals... and brings on the night as well as the sun going down in the desert or a cold beer in a smoky bar after work. It's as comfortable as your favorite slippers but as fresh as your clean skin after a shower. It's sad that Viktor isn't getting more exposure outside of his work as a studio musician, being Lyle Lovett's bassist, and having Alison as a sister. He's a talented musician and composer, and this disc has scarcely left my cd player since I bought it. My least favorite track is "Here To ...

This CD is even more amazing than the last one I purchased!! Imagine Dragons are just so fun to listen to. I only knew 2 songs, Thunder & Whatever It Takes, which I still like even more! But now I have even more favorites in Mouth of the River & Believer, they feed my soul. There isn't a song on this cd that I don't like. Keep them coming, I can't wait.

There is a nice mix of rock, pop, and hard rock within the songs of the album so there's a little bit for everyone.  I even enjoy this album.  I would recommend trying out this music group.  Their music is quite catchy.

At a Loss | Buzzoven is one of the most important sludge bands of all time, yet they are simultaneously one of the most underrated. This album is signature Buzzoven sludge heavily mixed aspects of stoner metal and punk rock. It is also of note that this album has one of their best line-ups with Ramzi (Sourvein) on drums and Dixie (Weedeater, Bongzilla, Barstul, Hail!Hornet, Sourvein) on bass.

It was quite scratchy sounding especially in the beginning
Just bought a new Audio Technica turntable and was looking through Amazon for new obscure musicians with vinyls. Needless to say that once I saw the cover to this I had to check youtube to see what they sounded like. I was blown away after hearing Babylon. Checked a couple more songs to verify it wasn't the only good song. Check! Purchased! A true Masterpiece!!! A great companion to this is also Lord Huron's Lonesome Dreams album. Both are refreshing compared to the standard pop junk you hear on the radio these days.If you aren't sure about Father John Misty, then I would recommend listening to a couple songs on youtube first. This way you don't buy the album, hate it, and leave a bad review.

The item description is Fear Fun. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Fear Fun is Josh Tillman’s first album where he performed under the name Father John Misty and it is a rollicking good time. There are honky-tonk songs, lounge singer-style songs, rock ‘n roll songs; the album runs a gamut of genres. The lyrics are wry, observational, clever and memorable. The musicians are top notch and Jonathan Wilson’s production serves the album well. I’ve had this album on regular rotation for years now and I don’t see that changing.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a vinyl copy - you won’t regret it.

Jagged Little Pill U.S. Version | "Jagged Little Pill", the first major release by Alanis Morrisette, became within a year only the second album to top a million sales in Australia. Given Alanis frequently being compared with the brilliant female alternative rockers of the last thirty years or so, the vast sales in Australia would seem as a surprise.However, any listen to "Jagged Little Pill" reveals no signs of the intense, dramatic, feminine tones that can lift music to considerable heights. The record was basically an undistinctive alternative rock album, with Alanis showing little tendency to actually sing but rather to shriek. Even though the musicians include such capable figures as Benmont Tench of the Heartbreakers, they were blurred over dense but tuneless guitars. This was seen at its worst on "You Oughta ...
The Sensual World | [[ASIN:B00004R7TP Hounds of Love's]] amazing personal narrative of a woman's spiritual struggle stands as one of the finest monuments ot the music world, and Kate Bush no doubt thought she could never emulate it. On "The Sensual World", the mystical themes are gone with the exception of the charming "Heads We're Dancing" which provocatively deals with the transformation of her lover into Adolf Hitler. In its place, are highly earthbound themes like the difficulty of remaining committed in modern society.The remarkable thing is that Kate manages still to show all her trademark qualities to great effect. The opening title track is as brilliant as "Running Up That Hill" or "Rubberband Girl" even though its lyrical theme relates not to spiritual experience but to sexual experience. "The Fog" ...

"What does this skinny little white kid from Cincinnati know about jazz?" you ask. Well, I don't have a lot of technical knowledge, but I know what I like. I've heard many recordings where there were quite a few notable musicians performing, but the music was really bad. Not so here. Aside from the obvious Miles presence, the listener is also treated to tenor sax legend John Coltrane, alto sax great Julian 'Cannonball' Adderley, piano protegy Bill Evans, plus the rythym section of Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums. You even get a splash of pianist Wynton Kelly on "Freddie Freeloader"! Aside from the controversy over who really wrote "Blue in Green" (was it Miles or Bill Evans?), there is no sour point to ...
I am not ashamed to say this- &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; has always been my favorite Miles Davis cd, bar none. For me, it has never been an issue. No other lp of his comes close.I've never been able to completely pin down why that is, but it all starts with the MOOD. There is such a relaxed, ethereal feel to this lp that none of his others has. The mixing and mastering was brilliantly done on this lp. The lp is almost an ambient (as Brian Eno would describe ambient- soft, background music) experience at points, and the deliberate softer mixing of this lp causes that to happen. It creates a relaxed, almost stoned feel to the lp (which could also be part of the mood ...

The item description is In A Silent Way. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: The rise of rock music in the late 1960s as the Boom Generation came of age had a profound influence on trumpeter Miles Davis. Eager to avoid being seen as trapped in a time-warp, but also unwilling to merely copy what rock artists were doing, over the course of the next five years Davis created a body of work that is by any standards his most lasting legacy and which led eventually to his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005/2006.<br /><br />In contrast to later works like [[ASIN:B0000027GU A Tribute to Jack Johnson]], "In a Silent Way" does not have any funky grooves or distorted electric guitar lines. Instead, the main instruments are three electric pianos, Davis' trumpet and Wayne Shorter's tenor saxophone, which combine to produce a sound that is remarkably slow, relaxed and touching all though the album's thirty-five minutes. Only very rarely does Davis' trumpet rise aboive the ambience of the pianos and occasional organ, but that does not detract from the flow on the first track "Shhh/Peaceful", which is really apt in its title given the furor of the time with the Vietnam War and the development of hard rock.<br /><br />On the second track, "In a Silent Way/It's About That Time", Davis' trumpet is much more prominent, but the undulating, slow, piano work that predates [[ASIN:B0000067X2 Future Days]]' use of this type of rhythms is still omnipresent. (Tony Williams' drumming is also something of a precursor to the more celebrated work of Jaki Liebzeit). The later part, "It's About That Time", is the nearest to "rock" but is still beautifully quiet and simple with the skeletal guitar lines doing no more than they have to. Near the end, akin to Future Days' title track, the band moves once more towards a more groove-oriented sound without losing the amazing flow of melody that had been achieved earlier on the record.<br /><br />All in all, "In a Silent Way" is an undoubted landmark that showed the use of rock instruments and recording techniques could achieve quite different effects - much more atmpsheric and melodic - that had ever been known before. From ambient to shoegaze, the influence of this recoridng cannot be doubted. Moreove,r the fact that it dented the Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums showed Davis' most important cultural role was only beginning.

This is one of my favorite megadeth albums. Some classic Megadeth tracks are on here, but this album was always looked as one of megadeths worst because of the production. Now that this album is newly remixed and remastered by Dave Mustaine himself, it sounds like it was supposed to- great songwriting without all that reverb. This is Megadeth's 3rd album, and it features their second recording lineup- Dave Mustaine, David Ellefson, Chuck Behler, and Jeff Young.Into the Lungs of Hell: 9/10The instrumental introduction to the album, and a good one at that.Set the World Afire: 10/10This is the first song that Dave wrote after being fired from Metallica in 1983, originally titled "Megadeth". This is one of the highlights of the album, with some cool lyrics ...
Before we start, get an idea of my opinion here; Top songs: 1. In My Darkest Hour, 2. Into the Lungs of Hell, 3. Set the World Afire, 4. Hook in Mouth, 5. Mary Jane, 6. Liar, 7. 502.Since the Live In Buenos Aires 2005 concert, STWA hasn't been played much, I think it's on the top 20 of Megadeth songs. Anyway, this album is awesome. In my opinion this is one of the albums that helped place Megadeth at the peak of Metal.

Congress of the Cow | For anyone who remembers Inch, they were a San Diego band from the early 90's who released their final album in 2000 (originally recorded in 1998). Stimy, vocalist of Inch is now in Congress of the Cow. This time around he added an extra guitarist to the line-up. Stimy's old band worked with Mark Trombino (Blink 182, Jimmy Eat World) and Steven Haigler (Local H, Nirvana) so its not surprise that you'll find elements of those bands in this album; he's learned from the best. But this time around Stimy has expanded his songwriting range and let it hang out. There isn't as much polishing, but the songs still come off indie-pop with the crunch and a few out there solos. Definantly check this out.
Slowreader | Rory Phillips and Gabe Hascall, formerly split the vocals in The Impossibles. Since The Impossibles break up, Rory and Gabe got back together to record this album. This album is pretty far from The Impossibles as you can get though. There are no guitar solos or screams; the entire album is piano and acoustic guitar driven, with Protools and drum machines.A review that I read, that is also quoted on the album's sticker, said 'is that this is a must have for fans of Elliott Smith and Ben Folds'; and that's pretty much right on the mark. Although I would say you gotta be a fan of mellower Ben Folds material.This album plays like a dreamscape. Its good to just sit back and relax to. If you ...

There have been a lot of band documentaries over the years, but this is simply one of the best. You feel like a fly on the wall watching the Truckers and their families and friends (as well as fans), tell their stories. Barr Weissman has done a fantastic job putting this all down on film. If you are a DBT fan, you won't hesitate a second to buy this. If you have even a remote interest in how a band gets some success and deals with it and creates its music, watch this documentary!

Target: As a Truckers fan there is no doubt you are going to love this.  Order it without question.  For me, I am an avid doc fan and really enjoy music docs, even when I never heard of the band.  Coming from the outside this does leave a little to be desired.  The insert that comes with the DVD has vocalist/guitarist Patterson Hood explaining this is not meant to be a "Behind the Music" tell all, which is important to note before you buy.  A majority of the doc explains Patterson's family roots in the music industry, shows Patterson with his family now, and has Patterson explaining what his songs are about.  The other members of the band aren't as open.  The Jason/Shonna divorce drama gets glossed over for instance.  You will get a good understanding of the band, but most people who are going to buy this know a large portion of it.

Curious Corn | This is the second album with Rad and Seaweed (_Become The Other_ being the first) and its definitely worth owning, in part because of the beautiful, deep production. This is possibly the best *sounding* Ozric album out of any of them. The bass is deep and ravenous and Ed, trying to top his greatest moment ever on the guitar (IMHO &quot;Vibuthi&quot; from _BTO_) is in outstanding form. &quot;Oolite Groove&quot;, showing off Ed's Steve Vai influence, and &quot;Curious Corn&quot; are amazing guitar workouts that are on par with anything from _Jurassic Shift_. But the real amazing songs are the first track, the ambient &quot;Spyroid&quot; with its incredible bowel-shaking acoustic bass, &quot;Afroclonk&quot; which has some of the most evil sounds ever to escape Ed's synths, and the climactic &quot;Meander&quot; ...
Kraan | ...by the incredible musical virtuosity involved. This is no half-hour-long-crank-up-the-delay-pedal-and-add-goofy-phasing-effects &quot;Kosmiche&quot; type of Krautrock. The band is ultra-tight, and the songwriting complex and multilayered. In fact, I hear more parallels with Return to Forever, Mahavishnu Orchestra, and especially early King Crimson - than some of the more minimalistic and avant-garde influences that their contemporaries shared. Don't let that scare you, this is tasty, adventurous music nonetheless, helped especially by the adventurous Johannes Pappert on sax, who rams that thing through wah, distortion, flanging, and gets some absolutely FREAKY sounds out of the exercise. Helmut Hattler, as any Krautrock afficianado will tell you, can throw down groove with the best of them. He's a monster on the bass. Peter Wolbrandt (sp?) throws down some funky guitar licks to ...

Take, for example, U2's latest.....It's so disappointing seeing what they used to release. Dave Matthews Band's new album is also a humongous disappointment. I know you are all wondering why I mentioned those artists when they are so drastically different from Tool. Trust me, it is VERY appropriate. Although both of those bands have had commercial success, neither did anything that was completely conventional....With their latest releases, however, they sold out to make the big bucks....On the other hand, we have Tool. With &quot;Lateralus&quot;, there is no fear of a commercial sell-out. ...
ok. i just bought this cd today.if your a long time TOOL fan, your going to like this cd. A LOT!! it's just fresh enough to be interesting, and at the same time, familiar enough to not alienate previous fans. the best songs, in my opinion, are THE GRUDGE, SCHISM (i think it's the first single), PARABOLA ( my favorite ...really rocks),AND LATERALIS. i'm sure more will emerge ,but i've only listened to it 3 or 4 time's. to sum thing's up. buy this cd. TOOL is one of the last great ,original rock-metal bands.

Target: I read somewhere a comment made by a person who preferred APC to Tool : &quot;They don't sound as Satanic.&quot; A ridiculous statement to be sure, but I couldn't help but reflect on that simpleminded thought listening to Aenima again, with its primal-scream, almost hateful lyrics, muddled production values, and evil-sounding interludes (&quot;Message to Harry Manback&quot;, &quot;+/- Ions&quot;, &quot;Die eier von satan&quot;).<br />But you don't get that sense with this album, the same drama is there, the same tension, even some of the same raw anger, but its much more coherent as a whole. And if, clocking in at a massive 78 minutes and 58 seconds, it rambles a bit at points, well, all the better to linger on a beautiful thought, don't you agree ? Listen to the lyrics Maynard sings over the deep and funky groove of Parabol/Parabola : &quot;Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing/Remember/We are eternal/All this pain is an illusion.&quot; Does this sound like the same Maynard who wrote Anenima, a corrosive fantasy about California dropping into the sea along with &quot;millions of dumbfounded dips****&quot; ?<br />And I don't know who slipped Danny Carey, resident mystic and &quot;batterie&quot; for Tool, the happy pill, but he is all over the place on this album. Bashing his skins like he has something to prove, and his life may just depend on it. Its the biggest drum sound I have ever heard on a rock album since Peter Gabriel and Jerry Marotta were doing the two-step in the early eighties.<br />&quot;The Grudge&quot;, the first King Crimson-like incantation on the album, is his most propulsive moment. At one point in this song, easily the most rhythmically complex thing Tool has ever attempted, he does three double-time tempo changes, one after the other, with double bass while pounding the snare.<br />My favorite moment on this album chock gosh-darn full of favorite moments is &quot;The Patient.&quot; In this song Maynard goes through all the emotions and moods and nails some absolutely riveting, majestic vocal harmonies. It represents the synthesis of all of the melodic possibilities that A Perfect Circle provided whilst sacrificing none of the near-thuggish, primal lurch that is the backbone of Tool. If the rest of the album had followed that direction, I would be more than satisfied with the 5-year wait, but instead Tool chooses to challenge the listener and take even more daring chances. There is the effectively venemous &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot;, quite possibly the only song on this album you might be able to label a &quot;throwback&quot;; the catchy single &quot;Schism&quot; (which is either a paean to troubled lovers, or perhaps a statement of healing from Maynard to the rest of the members of Tool, after the success of his side project APC) punctuated by Justin Chancellor's fantastic complex bass riff; the lyrical juxtaposition of Parabol/Parabola; or the near 22-minute slow simmer, Eastern-tinged suite of Disposition, Reflection and Triad, which sports some stunning textural Adam Jones/Justin Chancellor interlocking guitar/bass interplay.<br />There comes a point at which all successful musicians eventually reach no matter what their fan base is, where they have to make music they write or perform that is more for their own gratification than others, or else they have to rehash old formulas and eventually become some worn-out retread on the oldies circle (see also : John Kay and Steppenwolf). If they take that step, they can only hope that a few of their fans do get it. Looking at nearly 80 minutes of music, I am fairly certain that many of the music press will throw out accusations of self-gratification - or even worse, the &quot;progressive&quot; label of doom. But this is not that album. Its not even close to that album. Tool is trying to say something; they have a rare but undeniable death-grip on something deep, powerful and primal and the even rarer ability to bring it through in their music. Its mathematical and complex, to be sure, but not erudite and inaccessible. It is exhilarating and mystical.

Output: good

Christmas Oratorio | An ethereal, mystical and magnificent musical event. This recording transports me to a better place. The soloists and the spectacular choir excel. This is a treasure for the ages.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I have several other Beethoven Symphony's No. 6 ( Pastoral) but far and away Paav Jaravii is the besty! I have it on my car player, to help me keep cool in traffic. I have used it several times while working in the house. Every time I hear it, I find something else to easy my nerves and sooth my soul. If you are a fan of the music this is the one copy you should have.
I have one complaint about this otherwise stunning Second. Jarvi elicits some strange timbres from the horns in the first movement (are they muted?) which is interesting to say the least but somewhat unexpected. In all other respects, this is a pretty spectacular Second that stands with Vanska's fine Second as modern reference performances. Jarvi takes the allegro at a reasonable pace, unearthing some fantastic details along the way. I particularly love the prominence given to the winds; has their piquant and puckish writing in the first tutti outburst ever registered with such clarity before or have the bassoon, oboe, and flute interjections at the beginning of the development ever been so prominent? I can think of no other recording with such an array of colors. Or ...

The item description is Beethoven: Symphonies No.6 "Pastoral" & No.2 International Version. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Odd that I have reached my 70s before really appreciating Beethoven! It took this recording - specifically the 6th Symphony - to open my ears to the beauty and subtlety of his music. Prior to this I heard mainly the bombastic effects; in this recording I hear the delicacy of the individual instruments dancing through the score, playing together with joyous abandon. This is a small concert orchestra, about 30 + instruments, clearly defining each passage. The effect is lovely; the 2nd movement of the 6th transports me completely. The 2nd Symphony is wonderful as well. I love this recording, and have ordered another, the 9th. I am thankful to the conductor for giving me a later-life gift of Beethoven. It's never too late to find a new love, musically speaking!

Output: Excellent

Into the Night | All we can hope is Andy Rock goes into the night literally. This cd was one of those you listen to one time and struggle to just get through it because you purchased it by listening to other reviews mainly from hardrockhaven.net which is a rock site i respect but boy did they get this one wrong. It is now being used as a coaster to sit my beer on and come to think of it i should probably just put it in recycling. Nuff said.
Rewotower | All, Profusion is an Italian progressive rock/fusion group. Hence the name Pro-Fusion. This is their 3rd release and has some good song writing and they are more than competent in their respective positions from lead vocalist, guitar, drums,and keys. I bought this CD with no input from any source other than the band name and title made me curious. After a few spins I really enjoyed Rewotower from start to finish. Good production, good tunes and I think a very fair price for this purchase. You know what they say, when in doubt check it out. Jeff rocks

The item description is Wolf Pack. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I purchased this album with no knowledge of the band at all except curiousity. Son of a bitch does this group rock. The cd was recorded in Switzerland  and has help from some very high class musicians like Mat Sinner, Oliver Hartmann and many more hard rock folks who have been putting out great hard rock for decades. For lack of a better example think Lynyrd Skynyrd meets Adrenaline Mob. Great powerful in your face production and track 1 to end, Good vocals and shredding guitars and rhythm section. i defy anyone to not appreciate the quality of this group and hope they can top this with another release in the future. Well done,

Down To Earth | Jem is a Gem As with her finally woken, great listening music. Disappointing that there are not more albums by her. As a women, I find her lyrics very inspiring and the beat easy to connect with. Great for anyone.
Finally Woken | Jem is a Gem! very inspiring and artisitic. I had to use the book provided to understand the words as her style is slightly breathy, but the lyrics are wonderful too! The only downfall, there is not more of her music! Her style is relaxing, and not in your face. OK for the work place, home, or the car. All songs have the same consistant beat which ties the music together.
