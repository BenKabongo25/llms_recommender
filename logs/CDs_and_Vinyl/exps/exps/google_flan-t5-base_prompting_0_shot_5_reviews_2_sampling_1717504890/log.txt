Radio K.A.O.S. | Ill keep this short and sweet. The songs on here are pretty good and all Roger Waters fan should listen to this, but all new fans to his solo work should start with "Amused To Death" which will blow you away when you hear it, then the pros and cons, then this.
Relics | Relics is an album of classic Floyd songs from their earlier days, though i think that some songs should've had others in their place, but everybody has their own taste in songs. But any die-hard floyd fan must have this if not just, especially since its the only album that "Biding my Time" is on.
Brainwashed | I had never heard any of Harrison's solo work till I brought this, and truthfully i diddnt expect to much. But this is a really good album woth the songs having a soft, country kind of rock to them. The songs here are actually much better then what he wrote when he was with The Beatles. I think the highlights are "Brainwashed" "Any Road" and "Rising Sun", the former more of a rock sonh with the later 2 having a country feeling to them.
Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd | Echoes is possibly one of the greatest cd's that will go on sale for years. It shows the Pink Floyd at their greatest. Although I think they should've made it a 3-cd case since many classic Floyd songs such as "Have a Cigar", "Brain Damage/Eclipse", "Not Now John", "The Nile Song" "Cymbaline" and other great ones, it still has most of their great songs like "Hey You", "Time", "The Fletcher Memorial Home" "See Emily Play", and others which make it a must need album for any Floyd fan out there. Alot of Floyd fans though will probally notice the edits they made in "Echoes" and "Shine on You Crazy Diamond", but the most appearent is in "Marooned" where 4/5 of the song is missing, making it almost ...
The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn't You Miss Me? | I love Syd Barrett's work, with and without Pink Floyd, and musically it deserves 5 stars, but I think after all thses years his fans deserve more. What the record company should've done is put out an album of rare Syd songs from his carrer including non-released songs like &quot;Vegetable Man&quot; and &quot;Scream thy Last Scream&quot;, and early song just never put on record like &quot;Stoned Alone&quot;, &quot;Lucy Leave&quot; and &quot;King Bee&quot;

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
It's fairly obvious that Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall are the two overwhelming pressences in Pink Floyd's cataloge. They over shadow the other albums greatly in various ways: - sales - popularity - exposure - FM radio play - critical acclaim (in the case of DSOTM, not The Wall)However, the other albums that Pink Floyd constrewed in their many lifetimes as a band are quite execellent as well. One of These Days is a blistering hate athem. The seeminglessly uncontrolled slide guitar mixed with the careful build-up create one of the most energetic songs I've ever heard. Echoes is epic rock at its very best. A 23-minute classic. The rest of Meddle is jazzy, breezy, acoustic folk rock. None of those tracks are as ...
I am going to keep this short,this album sells itself and is excellent and has sounds that will appeal to every and any Pink Floyd fan.fantastic listening anytime but if you happen to be driving it will make any trip worth it.it contains a bit of everything Pink Floyd style.Buy it you won't be sorry!
For all the questionable praise "Meddle" received when it was released, it would still be a couple of years before Pink Floyd became phenomenons--this album was NOT their first set to crack the US Top 50, as inaccuracies might lead one to believe (that title went to their 1972 soundtrack album "Obscured By Clouds", which hit #46). One of their most highly praised pre-"Dark Side" releases, Pink Floyd's 1971 album "Meddle" is somehow simple in the winding journey of music it yields, yet at the same time very puzzling in its arrangements and overall production; the band itself produced the record, making the generally poor production all the more baffling. The first two tracks, the album's classic highlight 'One of These Days' and the lullabye 'A Pillow ...
This album could also of been called "Muddle", or "The Best And The Worst Of Pink Floyd".This becomes apparent after one listen, the first and sixth tracks on "Meddle" are superb; the other four aren't.The album opens with "One Of These Days" with whistling wind and then both, Gilmour and Waters, break in on. Lovely vibrant bass lines. The double bass carries on through out the song giving it a very heavy feel. The only words spoken are "One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces".The song was dedicated to Jimmy Young, the British Radio D.J., who the band had been having a running battle of words with for several years. The song reaches a dramatic climax with Gilmour laying down some of ...
I saw the original tour for this album around 71/72 and let me justsay that they were a far better, more completely rounded band in thosedays. Not that they are bad now, they are still great musicians, butI had the pleasure to witness the band 3 times in concert BEFOREthey became huge after Dark Side. I saw them later during theWish You Were Here tour and Animals tour and felt that they had lostsomething intimate as they grew richer and more famous. It thenbecame nearly impossible to get tickets for the shows as theywould sell out in an instant. If you were lucky enough to get tickets,the shows were generally uncomfortable and packed shoulder toshoulder. I find it much harder to enjoy shows in that capicty.Seeing them ...

The item description is Meddle. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Alot of people consider Meddle to be the start of Floyd's most creative period, while in fact Pink Floyd began their most creative period when they formed in 1966 and it never ended. But its easily noticable why many see Meddle as the start.<br />The album starts off with &quot;One of these days&quot;, which starts off with the sound of blowing wind, then Roger's bass kicks in to it finally climaxes to one hell of a powerfull piece with Nick saying &quot;One of these days I'm gonna cut you into little pieces.&quot;<br />Next to come in is the soft accoustic &quot;A Pillow of winds&quot;, its a little soft we smooth, sweet vocals, but its defitnly worth checking out.<br />Next comes your standard rock song, &quot;Fearless&quot; Really good musically, and lyrically inspiring to face difficulties in life.<br />&quot;San Tropez&quot; is what i consider the albums best song. It has a jazzy sort of beat to it, with Roger doing surprisingly smooth vocals that can be mistaken for Dave's singing. lyrically such things as wealth like the line &quot;Born in a house with no silver spoon, now im drinking champagne like a good tycoon&quot; appear, hints of latter things to come.<br />The last song on side 1 of the original vinyl's is &quot;Seamus&quot; I dont understand why so many people bad mouth this song. Sure, it was probally more funny to the band when they were drunk in the studio one night, but i dare anyone to listen to this song and not laugh. Besides, it does contain some nice blues music.<br />Lastly comes the ever famous &quot;Echoes&quot; This song does deserve every bit of fame it has, its 23min long, musically and lyrically great, and will simply astound you if your new to Floyd music<br />Meddle is definitly an album for either people already fans of Floyd, or trying their 1st Floyd music, so try it one day.

Come Upstairs | WHAT A DYNAMITE 'TOUR DE FORCE' FROM A LEGENDARY PEFORMER!!! This was such a breakthrough &amp; important Carly Simon album!!! Carly lets loose &amp; proves that she can ROCK with the best of 'em!!! 'Come Upstairs' is one HOT dance song that SHOULD have been released on a 12&quot;!!! And next, with the heavy bass of 'Stardust', she totally ROCKS you all over again!!! Yet with the fantastic ROCK side of this album, we are still treated to the gorgeous Carly introspective melodies that we expect from a Carly album! She does NOT disappoint!!! For example, there's 'James', &amp; the very sexy 'The Three of Us in the Dark' to entice her listeners! I have listened to 'In Pain' over &amp; over again because it just builds ...
Transformation: Best of | The underrated driving force behind the tour de force known as 'Labelle' spreads her wings &amp; flies high with this much-anticipated collection of SOLID songs!!! From her earliest solo efforts such as the ROCKIN' 'Tax Exile' (I LOVE that song!!!) to her disco-diva hits 'Keep It Confidential', 'B-Boys', 'I Sweat', &amp; the much sought after dance floor gym 'Bustin' Out' to her avante garde explorations such as 'Design for Living' &amp; 'Winds of Change' - THIS is Nona at her finest!!! You will certainly NOT be disappointed with this CD - it is sublime!!! What a writer!!! What a ROCKER!!!! Nona's first solo album came out years ago when it was extremely RARE for a black female singer to really ROCK. (The only other I can think ...
Anticipation | Buy this amazing CD of early Carly!!! It contains the AMAZING 'Legend in Your Own Time' - which stands among the BEST of music. But you MUST listen to 'Share the End' &amp; 'I've Got to Have You' which also stand among the BEST - but are much lesser-known songs! These songs are so amazing that they just get better &amp; better with each listen!!! And what a treat to hear early Simon with all these beautiful hints of the true greatness to come with her amazing array of hits!!! She is a classic 'Diva' - meaning 'Diva' in the best &amp; most respected use of the word!!! Often imitated, NEVER duplicated - Carly is AMAZING!!! You will cherish this CD!!!!!
Hotcakes | 'Hotcakes' contains 2 of my very very favorite Simon Songs: 'Just Not True' &amp; 'Forever My Love'. These have to be 2 of the most perfectly beautiful songs ever recorded. If these 2 songs don't make you feel something, then you need help!!! I still get chills when I hear either of these lush, gorgeous songs. And along with Carly's jazzy classic dittie, 'Hotcakes' (the title track), you simply can't miss with this AMAZING CD!!! Nothing compares to Miss Carly Simon!!! Absolutely nothing!!! Sheer perfection!!!!!!
Nightwalker | POWERFUL!!! LIVING THE FAST LIFE!!! MAGNIFICENT CD!!!!!! Starting off with the electric, magnificent 'Nightwalker' title track, this CD sweeps you onto the neon streets of New York on an emotional journey of love, drama, &amp; excitement!!! 'Seek &amp; You Will Find' picks up the beat &amp; ROCKS!!! 'Santa Rosa' paints a picture of elegant afghans, &amp; &quot;the sun &amp; sand on my shoulder&quot; while &quot;breaking away&quot;!!! Of course, there's the classic 'Living Inside Myself', a hit loved by MILLIONS (check out the record sales)!!! You can feel the electricity here, with Gino giving it his all, as usual!!! A MASTERPIECE!!!! GINO RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wreck of the Day | Love this CD! I love everything about Anna Nalick.. her sultry sound, the words to her songs.. she's earthy and eloquent.. Can't get enough of her singing!
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 Soundtrack | Love this soundtrack! If you liked the books and love the movies, the Soundtracks are a must have! Get them!
Babel | This is a good CD, but I personally like &#34;Sigh no more&#34; better. I'm sure once I've listened to it a few times it'll grow on me. You can't go wrong with Mumford & Sons!
Sigh No More | I heard of this band through friends of mine before I'd ever heard any of their music on the radio, so I've enjoyed their music for awhile now. This CD is AWESOME! I love the whole thing! Get it... you won't be disappointed!

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
This is a great album. There are hints of Nickle Creek, but without the sort of poppy prissy sound that Nickle Creek and the Punch Bros can sometimes have. There are elements of Crooked Still but without the sort of pretentiousness or lack of emotion that sometimes Crooked Still has at times.You can hear all the influences on this album but this is an album that actually improves on all the influences rather than succumbing to the weaknesses of some of the music that inspires it.
Having just downloaded "A Song Up in Her Head" I immediately wanted to compare Sarah to Abigail Washburn [[ASIN:B00175G7DQ Abigail Washburn & The Sparrow Quartet (Dig)]]. This comparison is based not only on both incredible artists claw hammer banjo style but also on their vocal styles and the high caliber of musicians they have each drawn to them. Then there is that cello picking out the base lines. It seemed to me that Sarah is like a younger, less traveled version of Ms. Washburn. This is not to cast aspersions upon Sarah who I believe is a very talented and strong musical force to be reckoned with from this day forth. My next purchase will be the CD of my download just for the liner notes
Sara Jarosz never fails to deliver!!!!!!!!!! I've seen her at the Rice Festival each year. Such a good CD!!!
Sarah Jarosz's great CD is appropriately titled Song Up in Her Head. What I love most about this work is the raw feel that it has and its originality. I can play this CD straight through without skipping any of the unique tunes contained on it. While the music does remind me of Nickle Creek, Jarosz also provides many points of departure from that group. Some of my favorites are "Tell Me True," "I Can't Love You Now" and the melodic "Long Journey." The lyrics performed by Jarosz are thoughtful at times and quite memorable. Notice how the CD concludes with the tune "Little Song." How I look forward to the next effort from this fresh and entertaining songbird.
I was extremely impressed with this album and Sarah as a true artist. Uncommonly talented in all categories: songwriting, singing, and instrument playing... she goes far beyond what anyone would consider bluegrass. I do appreciate traditional bluegrass music, but Sarah's music is fresh, modern and original. Her music blends many other influences - folk, classical, indie - and creates some of the most beautiful, joyous, mood-lifting original music I've heard in years! Some might say "she's good for her age", but I say, there's no one at ANY age that's doing it better!!

The item description is Song Up In Her Head. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: This is Sarah's first CD, and after hearing her on PBS, I had to have it!  I love her style of songwriting and singing and the mix of the old time and more contemporary bluegrass.  She takes an old familiar sound and makes it all her own.  Listen to it!

Love Bon Jovi and this is no exception.
I liked some of the new songs on this CD-but it is not their usual rock n' roll. Different style of singing in this CD.
They are back and better than ever. I really enjoyed this latest release from the boys from Jersey!
I love this album. It's music and it's lyrics are so compelling. I've loved their music for years, (except for This Left Feels Right 😕, sorry guys.) For the few that did not get it, LISTEN MORE CLOSELY! This album is truly a sublime experience.V.V's Exquisite Handcrafted Jewelry

The Basement Tapes | Call me crazy, but for my money, this is the best rock n roll album of all time. It nudges out more obvious choices ("Abbey Road," "Revolver," "Exile on Main Street") and more cult-classic picks ("Pet Sounds," the first two Big Star albums, London Calling), and even tops the Dylan catalog so far as I am concerned. Why? For one thing, it's raw, real, and gritty, something all too lacking in many mainstream rock releases. For another, it's got a sense of humor. Again, all too rare in post-Beatles rock, where the serious side of angst gets explored ad nauseum. For me, this is everything that the Beatles "Get Back" sessions should have been but weren't. It's a band goofing off, having fun, not trying to impress ...
Howlin' Wolf / Moanin' in the Moonlight | This disc, which is a compilation of two early Howlin Wolf albums minus one track, I believe, is one of those seminal precursors to the music of the next four and a half decades (and counting). It's got that raw edge that's missing from so much of the music that followed it, and a depth and power that's frightening at times. Really, this is one-in-a-million stuff that might scare you. If you really dig on this kind of sound, you might enjoy &quot;Spotlight Kid/Clear Spot&quot; by Captain Beefheart, who picked up on this eccentric electric blues thread and ran with it past the endzone and out into the street. Tom Waits also has this feel in his bluesier material. But this will never be topped.
A Go Go | An easy listen all the way through- a friend once described it as something like sophisticated funky bachelor-pad music and that's not so wrong. There's a lot of subtlety that will grow on you, trust me, it's addictive and fun. Great for driving, chillin at home, sitting and thinking. It's feels less forced than some of Sco's later &quot;Jam&quot; efforts and MMW doesn't head for outer space here so it's a decent intro to their sound for the uninitiated. Flawless.
The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society | This is the album that put Ray Davies on a par with the great Lennon/McCartney team, and all the other Brit giants that ruled the roost back in the day. For me, this album has true lasting value for its straightforward and unflinching commentary on the modernization of the world which was occurring simultaneously with the great rebellion of the 60s (and hasn't stopped since). Davies picked up this theme of old-vs-new again on &quot;Muswell Hillbillies,&quot; another teriffic record with a bluesier feel. But while &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot; sometimes heads over the top in the type of commentary it delivers (&quot;I was born in a welfare state/ruled by bureaucracy&quot;), this one is a bit subtler and more ambivalent. &quot;Big Sky&quot; is my personal favorite song here, posing the ...
Slip Stitch & Pass | Phish is an amazing band, no question. This release is one I keep coming back to for &quot;Taste,&quot; the final track on the disc, and the two covers, &quot;Cities&quot; and &quot;Jesus Left Chicago&quot;. The latter is one of my favorite tracks on any album, period. It shows Phish tackling a genre they usually don't approach so directly- the blues- with a style and grace that almost convinces me they are a blues-rock band masquerading as a prog-funk outfit. I am amazed that Trey can nail that sound so well, when he seems to practice it so rarely. It speaks volumes for the versatility of Trey and the band as a whole. The rest- good- but &quot;A Live One&quot; is better overall as it is &quot;edgier&quot; and sounds ...

After hearing this, I think the Anthology needed 1 more volume, so that #3 could be 2 discs devoted just to the White Album outtakes! Also... disc 2 of this just tantalized those of us Beatles fans who think NOW IS THE TIME for GET BACK: THE ORGINIAL ALBUM! These 2 discs are great just to listen to, and I love putting disc1 in my CD shuffle with both White Album discs, it is so fun! ...hm... this whole series is just so nostalgic... if Elvis releases new albums ever year after being dead all this time.. what of the Beatles? Come on Apple!
Anthology 3 is an album that is really great. The demos of the songs we know are great to hear because it's brand new all over again. All of the tracks are a smooth ride. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr might have started to try their own things, but when you put these tracks all together you know it's another great Beatles masterpiece. The first disc is fun and a great view of The Beatles creative period during the &quot;White Album.&quot; The second disc is just Rock 'n' Roll. Nothing fancy just great songs with The Beatles jamming together. George Harrison represents this Anthology by calling it &quot;the best of the three&quot; in his book. In my opinion I believe it is too. This is an outstanding ...
Anthology 3 covers the period from 1968-1970 that includes the releases "The Beatles," "Abbey Road" and "Let it Be." As with the previous Anthology issues, it contains mostly outtakes, demos and early versions of well-known songs, plus several unreleased songs. It's best to be familiar with the thre disks mentioned above before delving into this material. The package is loaded with material, the liner notes are informative, and again, it's like being a fly on the wall of the studio listening to the development of some great songs. That said, some of these takes are far from great.Disk 1 is mostly material from "The Beatles" aka "The White Album" and reflects that disjointed period in the quality of many of these versions. A lot of these songs ...
The last of the Anthology series is a fun listen, especially with the fan titled &quot;White Album&quot; material being presented in acoustic settings and earlier, but complete, renditions. And while &quot;What's the New Mary Jane&quot; isn't going to be the great unreleased Beatles song some may have been hoping for, it is enjoyable if you're into Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd. There's a lot that is fun here, including the newest &quot;clues&quot; in the great Paul is Dead hoax. The picture of Paul from Rubber Soul has been sliced through the head (top to bottom) and then put back on slightly askew, which of course represents the decapitation in the car accident. There is more, but I'm not going to ruin your fun in finding the others. ...
This is painful to listen to (and not in a good way like say, &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;). Two stars only because it's the &quot;Fab Four&quot;.

The item description is Anthology 3. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: There seems to be a true variety of opinion as to the merit of this collection, indeed of the anthology series as a whole, among music fans. Some love these ragged rough cuts and outtakes, some hate 'em. Well, put me in the camp of those who can't get enough. I'll admit I'm a Beatles fan, that's my bias, and this remains true even though I am aware that what was once a &quot;good little rock n roll band&quot; has become something of a corporation bent on churning out as much old material as possible so as to make a profit. The way I see it, there are many, many worse things you could sell the public than the music contained in this set (actually set 1 of the anthology series is among those worse things!).<br />These discs really humanize the Beatles during a time when their legendary status made it seem that they could do no wrong in the eyes of the public. The White Album and Abbey Road have such a mystique that it has become verboten to criticize them at all (and in fact, these are both in my top-ten list of all time records). But here we can hear the band coming up with their ideas, trying things out, constructing songs from the ground up. Having fun, even. It's an engaging listen. I actually enjoy the material from &quot;Get Back&quot; the most, especially some of the oldies covers and the really stripped-down versions of the originals. This is closer than EITHER &quot;Let It Be&quot; or &quot;...Naked&quot; to the concept behind &quot;Get Back&quot; (I wish more of the oldies covers from this period were commercially available). But there's nothing really weak here from any period, save &quot;Whats the New Mary Jane&quot; which is one of the worst songs I have ever heard (the original acoustic version, on the &quot;Beatles Unplugged&quot; bootleg, is not so bad, however).<br />So, a qualified recommendation...buy the three albums from this period first (White Album, Abbey Road, and Let it Be), and then come back for this. If you do that, and you are anything like me, you will be glad you did. This is some of the greatest music of all time.

Output: Review: Phish is an amazing band, no question. This release is one I keep coming back to for &quot;Taste,&quot; the final track on the disc, and the two covers, &quot;Cities&quot; and &quot;Jesus Left Chicago&quot;. The latter is one of my favorite tracks on any album, period. It speaks volumes for the versatility of Trey and the band as a whole. The rest- good- but &quot;A Live One&quot; is better overall as it is &quot;edg

My Life | My Life is one of my all time favorite CDs. I have listened to it so much over the last 6 years. It's like music-therapy. The title song, My Life is so beautiful, the words are so real. This is definitely Mary's best. I don't think it can be topped. The other tracks that are really hot are: I Love You, I'm The Only Woman, Be With You, Don't Go, Be Happy and Mary's Joint. This CD is a Must Have for all Mary fans.
Mama's Gun | Being that I am a HUGE Erykah Badu fan I couldn't wait to run out to get Badu's new CD. I really like most of the songs. The tracks that really caught my attention are: Didn't Cha Know, Cleva, Time's A Wastin', Orange Moon, Green Eye's and of course Bag Lady. ... I really don't want to compare this CD with the 1st one yet, because I need to listen a little longer.
Erykah Badu Live | What can I say that others haven't already said? Erykah Badu is a great singer, writer and performer. I bought this CD the day it came out in Nov. 1997 and it's still on heavy rotation in my CD player. It's definitely going to be a classic. This is a CD that just about everyone can relate to. I love the songs Ye Yo, Other Side of The Game, Searching, Stay and Next Lifetime. I love all the songs on this recording. I can't wait for the next CD. It's coming soon.
Serenade | BEAUTIFUL SLOW MUSIC, SENTIMENTAL LOVE SONGS. THE SONG TITLED DIANA STAYS WELL PUT IN MY MIND SINCE WAY BACK WHEN. THIS ARTIST SHOULD HAVE MADE IT BIG.
Soul Catcher | I SAW OLU'S VIDEO ON BET AND FROM THAT ONE SONG I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE THE CD. I AM TRULY GLAD I MADE THIS PURCHASE. THE CD STAYED IN MY BOOMBOX FOR WEEKS. I ESPECIALLY LOVE THE TRACKS, SISTA WHY?, LONG WAY AND MY WORLD. UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANY RADIO AIRPLAY IN MY CITY FOR ANY OF OLU'S SONGS. I JUST FEEL IT'S A SHAME HOW RADIO STATIONS WILL PLAY ONLY CERTAIN SONGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN THEY COULD BE PLAYING REAL MUSIC LIKE OLU. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ALL FUTURE PROJECTS.

There's really no bad cuts on the disc. It's just smooth through and through. Definitely a purchase.
Mr. Benet came out with no bars! With his sexy first c.d. true to myself Eric Benet shines like a diamond in the rough. He's different from others that sing with his heart open and his soul on his sleeve! I liked the fact that he made a song for the ladies that describes us to a T ! Also with songs like Lets Stay Together and True To Myself your sure to bump this in your c.d. players everywhere! So give it a try, because you won't be let down!
Eric Benet's debut &quot;True To Myself&quot; is still a classic in the year 2000. I have to admit that I did not buy this when it first came out. I was looking for some CDs to buy at a Circuit City one day and they played 3 songs from this CD, so I decided to purchase it. For anyone that likes r&amp;b with a little classic soul attached to it, Eric Benet is the one for you. On this CD and on his current CD, &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;, Eric Benet demonstrates that he can be versatile. He can give you the smooth r&amp;b funk grooves and he can also give you some ballads to remember. &quot;More Than A Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;Spiritual Thang and a remake to ...
Two words. &quot;Like Butta&quot;. Eric doesn't sing. He SANGS! Silky. Soulful. Sensitive. Sensual. Smooth. Seductive. The cut that brought me to this album was &quot;Femininity&quot;, however, every single track on this LP is wonderful. Especially the tear-jerking &quot;While You Were Here&quot;. I've yet to see Eric in concert, but I know the show will be worth the wait. He not only masters the art of singing. The emotion and passion he pours into his songs is soul-stirring and that in itself is not an easy task to acheive. This man is so underrated it hurts, but then again, the TRUE talents are. I'm sure the world will soon realize the gem that is Eric Benet. I anxiously await the next release and hope to see the next ...
When I was looking to add to my CD collection, a friend suggested this CD. I am so glad she did!!! This is a wonderful CD. Mr. Benet has a great voice and a sound that is all his own. He doesn't copy other artists. He truly stands on his own. This is a great addition to anyones CD collection and I highly recommend it.

Target: I have been following Eric Benet since I first heard the song titled &quot;Say Love&quot; on Jeff Lorber's CD, which features Mr. Benet. So when I saw the video for &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; on BET I ran out and purchased Eric's debut CD.  Wow! Wow! Wow!  I drove my sisters half crazy with this CD.  It's one you can put in the CD player and keep in for weeks, not skipping a track.  I love the songs True To Myself (which he did a commercial with his daughter India), Femininity, and I'll Be There.  But nothing can touch the heart warming song &quot;While You Were Here&quot;(dedicated to his daughter's mother who passed away tragically) Eric is an excellent singer and definitely will be around for a while.  I'm  a big fan.

Output: I'm The Only Woman, Be With You, Don't Go, Be Happy and Mary's Joint. This CD is a Must Have for all Mary fans.

It takes a long time to get a voice like Marianne has, ans a lot of Living.She uses it well on this cd, and I really can't get My Friends Have out of my head.But it's the voice that pulls it all toghether.
Since the release of Marianne Faithfull's blistering 'Broken English' (1979), Faithfull's audience has been impatiently waiting for the vocalist to fully fulfill that album's artistic promise. Though 'Dangerous Acquaintances' (1981) was a solid if less brazen follow up, 1983's 'A Child's Adventure' centered on defeat and exhausted victimization; several tracks wallowed in the very kind of material that 'Broken English' had been such a volcanic reaction against.Since that time, and despite the guidance of Hal Wilner, Angelo Badalamenti, and other notable impresarios, Faithfull has slogged through a series of largely fragmented, poorly focused, and occasionally embarrassing albums, each of which has contained several riveting tracks buried among some very tepid material indeed. Thus, Faithfull's releases over the last 20 years have become increasingly difficult to become enthusiastic ...
For me, this is her most satisfying album since the mighty Broken English. I guess being a Nick and Polly Jean fan, I am somewhat biased in rating the music, but this really is a great album.Every track has something distinctive, from the Cirkus of Death feel in City of Quartz, the closing number, to gothic ballads such as There Is A Ghost and the punchy My Friends Have; and the minimalist style is a breath of fresh air in an age of over-production.The striking cover photo presumably contrasts the innocence of youth as symbolized by the young girl lying aross Marianne's lap with the spiritual attrition that results from Life, age and experience.Brilliant.
I have to say that my respect for Marianne Faithfull has been greater for her character and the bare honesty with which she's lived her life, than due to my love for most of her recordings of the last fifteen years.Of course, this has changed dramatically with the release of Before The Poison. This album reveals Faithfull's talent and depth of emotion more than anything in a long time, perhaps harking back as far as Broken English.It is, actually, an interesting paradox, that she can sound so authentically herself although most of the great songs in this CD have been written by other people, and in some cases -No Child Of Mine and Last Song- recorded by their authors before this album was even planned.Whereas Kissin' Time, ...
What a fantastic experience, listening to this album. As much as I enjoyed Kissin' Time, Before The Poison stands as a whole, most definitely thanks to Marianne Faithfull's choice in collaborators. Polly Jean Harvey and Nick Cave, in particular, stand out as true devotees to the power of Faithfull's instrument.Like the AllMusic Guide's review, I find No Child Of Mine to be the flagpole that the other songs fit around. Magnificent in its melancholy, it strikes the mood fairly early on and harnesses every other song firmly to the solid ground.Organic sounds replace the overwhelming technology of Kissin' Time to satisfying results. Marianne Faithfull's voice needs room to breathe and move and this album's instrumental tracks do nothing to hinder her power. A masterful piece of work.

Rocky Mountain High | With the release of this album in 1972, John Denver was launched into superstardom. All the elements he then used to achieve such singular fame and fortune as the best-selling and most popular singer of the 1970s is here, from the anthem-like &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot;, a song that almost single-handedly began the outdoor backpacking, hiking, and orienteering movements of the young babyboomers, who like John, were more than ready for the kind of unconventional intimacy with nature he sang about so effortlessly and so elegantly. From &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; to &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot; (written by Lennon and McCartney) to the ironic country-music favorite &quot;Paradise&quot;, the simple and well arranged acoustic blast of infectious energy and sweet simplicity that was John Denver is here. Whether it is in ...
To Our Children's Children's Children | As with their earlier concept albums, the opening cut of this third of the four such concept albums released by the Moody Blues in rapid fire succession tells it all, a provocative, thoughtful, and intellectually fascinating exploration of a range of problems surrounding the possibility of life in a post-apocalyptic world. It amazes me that most of the other reviewers don't seem to recognize the basic concept of this album, so they trivialize it without understanding its basic premise. As in their previous albums, the Moody Blues use a rock style fusing mainstream rock music and eastern musical forms, and with a singular virtuosity that is spellbinding to listen to. No one carried such musical explorations with more panache and style than the Moody Blues, who, to ...
Rocky Mountain Collection | This is a wonderful compilation featuring most of the best songs written and performed by John Denver. This is one of the first of the posthumous releases of many his best-known songs. Included are many of the monster hits that propelled him into amazing popularity and superstardom in the early 1970s. In his heyday no one was outselling his albums or out-booking John for concert appearances, and considering the incredible talents on the scene at the time, that is a pretty good indication of just how popular he was, and just how universal John Denver's appeal was. No one else sang of the wide-open possibilities and seemingly limitless possibilities for a good life awaited those who would free themselves from the bonds that confined them and just ...
Jackson Browne | What do you say about an album you've had to replace twice on vinyl before finally scoring a hit on a CD that is still with you? That this is likely the single best debut album of the late sixties-seventies singer/songwriter genre with the possible exception of James Taylor? That the song cycle, singing, and instrumentation here is what still distinguishes Browne as a singular singer/songwriter/artist from all the others? That you still smile every time you hear the last few lines of "Looking Into You"? This album introduces Jackson Browne and his world of self-examination, endless speculation, and dreamy ruminations about the world at large according to Jackson as he sees it. And of course, he sees it with remarkable aplomb, set to beautiful lyrics and ...
Gord's Gold | I have always been a fan of Canadian Gordon Lightfoot's music. From the first time eI heard Peter, Paul and Mary's wonderful covers of Lightfoot songs like &quot;Early Morning Rain&quot; and &quot;For Loving Me&quot;, I knew anyone who could write songs like that was a huge talent. So when I got turned onto his own voice and music I was astonished by just how good he was (and still is). This is a perfect album because, like several of his other releases, each of the dozen songs included is something you smile at as it first comes on because it is a special favorite. So the song cycle here is unforgettable, because it has so many terrific Lightfoot songs back to back. The first song is &quot;I'm ...

Get this album for no other reason than the following three tracks: Barangrill, Electricity, and Judgement of the Moon and Stars (Ludwig's Tune). The wistfulness of the first two is joyous while the introspection of the latter is equally great. The versions of Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire, For The Roses, Woman of Heart and Mind, and You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio found on her live album Miles of Aisles are actually better than those found on For The Roses. This time around she muddles them in too much production, whereas on Miles they gain better power, clarity, and meaning through the stripped down renditions on solo acoustic guitar. Electricity, though one of her least known tracks, is I feel the crown jewel of ...
&quot;Blue&quot; is the undisputed masterpiece of Joni Mitchell and I would never argue with the reputation of this sublime folk classic. &quot;For the Roses&quot; was released after that stroke of genius and before the chart-topper which was &quot;Court and Spark&quot;.&quot;For the Roses&quot; is my favourite Joni Mitchell album. I'll never forget the first time I heard the song &quot;Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire&quot;. It struck me as such a basic tune, yet it affected me so deeply that I played the song again and again. The lyrics of this album are true poetry. A friend of mine purchased the book which contains all of Joni's songs printed as poetry. Her favourite works all come from this album...and she had never heard the songs. She was almost ...
This album can break your heart. It's a sweet pain, but excruciating none the less. It's her best.
I've only made 2 mistakes with reguard to Joni Mitchell and buying her music... For some reason, which at present I cannot remember, I listened to friends and critics and not the album and so I didn't buy it till many, many years later. When I was sitting in a bar one evening with friends and the small folk rock group doing the music that evening while they were on break we got into a discussion about artists and some of our favorites. At that point in time I was into listening to, what was at the time, Joni Mitchell's newest offering: &quot;Chalkmark in a Rainstorm&quot;. I'd been trying to tell friends how wonderful her newest release was and that it had been grammy nominated too! The ...
My grandmother, a force unlike any other, introduced me to this album soon after it came out. I was spending the summer with her on her farm, and after working all day, we'd sit in the kitchen, sipping something potent, and she'd play this. She liked it because the songs are about a woman who is strong, independent, clever and resilient. Joni sings &quot;I spring from the boulders like a mama lion.&quot; My grandmother loved that. And so did I. Still do. She's been gone 4 years now, but I always play this when I go home to visit. And you should too.

Target: When it comes to pleasing lyrical surprises wrapped in memorable melodies, no one comes close to delivering the way Joni Mitchell does. Indeed, someday long in the future, when someone wants the perfect example of a stellar and singularly talented singer/songwriter and a peripatetic innovator of 20th century music, they will dust off any of a dozen of Joni Mitchell's albums and give it a spin. This particular album represents her at her eclectic best, moving through a romantic landscape, calculating an emotional calculus as she does, spinning imaginative concoctions and personal equations with measured levels of method and abandon, using a variety of styles and approaches, fusing jazz and blues to her popular venue, resulting in a captivating and quite arresting collection of works.<br /> My personal favorites here  include her smash hit &quot;You Turn Me On, I'm A Radio&quot;, &quot;Blond In The Bleachers&quot;, &quot;Woman Of Heart And Mind&quot;, and &quot;Judgment Of The Moon And Stars (Ludwig's Tune)&quot;, but the entire album is excellent, as usual for Ms. Mitchell. From beginning to end this song cycle is an ardent but soft-spoken exploration of her internal landscape, a tour of her thoughts and feelings about the state of contemporary relationships. The song cycle represents an informal inventory of her feelings and emotions about herself, her  friends, and the world at large. Never one to stand still, this effort followed the  immensely popular &quot;Blue&quot; , preceding the jazzy, experimental &quot;Court and Spark&quot;.<br />Each of these albums is both unique and quite different from the others, and as a body of work illustrates he r fantastic creativity and ability to change style s and venues like so many suits of stylish clothing. Here in particular Mitchell's gorgeous and intricate lyrics, melodies and acoustic guitar arrangements meld into the strings, horns, and piano work to create an indescribably beautiful work. As with her other work, this album shows Joni at her apex, full of hope, compassion, and with all her creative juices flowing. For folk fans and people just interested in one of the best albums to have come out of her unforgettable stable of mysteries, this is an essential album. Enjoy.

The first and last tracks (sweet tears, a wee bit) are magnificent performances, and 'searching' isn't a bad effort either. But sadly the two keys players are realy cut down in most of the tracks by the poor quality of early 90s synths. Ayers' own performance is also diminished by the electronic KAT he plays on, it simply doesn't compare sound-wise to a real vibraphone.Perhaps Ayers' most well known song, 'everybody loves the sunshine' is quite bizzare in this concert. Very slow and ponderous, it fails to capture the good vibes of the studio, or indeed earlier concert recordings.Despite some of the atrocious sounding instruments, the showmanship and musicianship of the band is phenominal. Very tight drumset and bass playing, incredible saxophone solos and as always with ...

Gotta Tell You | Hey, not every girl from Ireland sounds like Enya or Sinead, and Samantha is proof positive of that. One of the few European pop acts to get North American airplay, Mumba hit #2 UK with her first hit, the now ubiquitous Gotta Tell You. Much of the album follows the same path of putting current pop arrangements against songs that could have as easily been hits at anytime in the past 30 years. Her next single, Body II Body, is based on and uses samples from David Bowie's early 80's hit Ashes To Ashes.The songs are sweet without being saccharine, streetwise without being smartass. This girl could easily outlast Britney, Christina and Jessica.

Here's the tracklisting: Track Listings Disc: 1 1. Rachel Stevens - Some Girls 2. Shapeshifters - Lola's Theme - These first to tracks entered at #2 & #1 respectively on last week's UK singles chart. &quot;Some Girls&quot; is a very catchy pop tune, and &quot;Lola's Theme&quot; is a huge dance track. 3. Anastacia - Left Outside Alone --- When, oh when will American radio pick up on this homegrown talent? This is one of the best tracks of the year. Half Evanescence, half Bonnie Raitt. 100% talent. 4. Kelis - Trick Me -- Mediocre &quot;Milkshake&quot; follow-up 5. Jamelia - ...
Escapology | It is difficult for Americans to fathom just how big Robbie Williams is overseas. The only contemporary American to achieve this level of success at home is Eminem. And although they would seem to be oceans apart, there are similarities.Both have won their countries biggest music awards. Both get widespread critical and commercial success in their homeland. And both are the subject of seemingly insatiable public appetite for details on their private life. Both have a strong creative partner - Dre for Eminem, Guy Chambers for Robbie.But where everyone in the US under 30 has grown up in a hip-hop dominated country, the youth of the UK were raised on pop (Spice Girls)and rock (Oasis). Robbie neatly straddles the border between those two genres by contrasting often ...
God Bless The U.S.A. | Having the kids of American Idol sing "God Bless The USA" is like putting gold trim on a '79 Ford Pinto. It may pretty it up, but it's still a piece of junk.Americans, rightly or wrongly, have a habit of embracing any song, no matter how awful, that says something they deem positive about their country. Sometimes they get lucky with songs such as Irving Berlin's "God Bless America".Too often, however, they embrace dreck like this jingoistic jingle.Like I said, I know I'm asking for trouble on this and will probably set the Amazon record for negative votes. So be it.But try this test. If you are familiar with the song, sing it substituting "Australian" for "American" and "God bless Australia" for "God bless the USA". Surely ...

If you're a Beatles fan that grew up listening to the stereo LPs, you'll be thrilled with the quality of the CD set. Even the "fake" stereo cuts such as "I Want To Hold Your Hand" and "She's A Woman" possess a magical quality.The unfortunate packaging is the only aspect which keeps my rating from being a 5-star triumph. Is it a long box or a fold-up book? It appears good intentions were dashed by a rush release.Still, it's all about the music, and that will not disappoint.

Target: If you took everything the Beatles officially released from Please Please Me thru Real Love, singles and albums, B-sides and "rareties", you could comfortably put the whole she-bang on 7 CD's.<br /><br />But, of course, that way Capitol, Paul & Yoko wouldn't make nearly as much money.<br /><br />So instead the relatively limited ouevre of the Beatles is doled out in small quantities. With lots of padding and lots of duplication. Having already released each Beatles album in the original UK Parlaphone configuration, then putting out 3 double CD anthologies of alternate takes, a single CD Greatest Hits, an extended Yellow Submarine "songtrack" and a "Naked" Let It Be, we are now blessed with the original US configurations of the Beatles albums.<br /><br />But since the price doesn't justify the equivalent of 100 minutes of 40 year old music that could fill a 2-CD set with room to spare, Capitol pads this package with both the Mono & Stereo versions of the same tracks. C'mon, do you really need two mixes of Mr Moonlight?<br /><br />Yes, the Beatles were wonderful, probably the most creative group in the history of music. Certainly still my all time favorite band.<br /><br />But this is not the band at their creative peak. Most of these albums were recorded in a rush, some songs in a single take.<br /><br />These are cubic zirconium songs that are being sold for the price of diamonds.<br /><br />And, yeah, I'll probably buy it anyway.

Leon Russell And The Shelter People | Leon bangs the ivories as well as Anyone- this is an example of unharnessed genius with talented energetic friends - this album was a comfort 40+ years ago and remains so, with the addition of some Dylan tunes that respect the man with accuracy and honesty. Do yourself a favor
Live 2 | Plush in every Velvet way, except perhaps a dip in recording quality. A live set that sizzles, along with Volume1. Two whacks of Heroin, Sister Jane, Pale Blue Eyes and many more that transport you through time. I think the best of the live/bootleg recordings.
The Legendary Atta Isaacs - Innovative Slack Key Master | Atta, Gabby, Cyril and Sonny are the reasons I TRY to play slack key. All of them are blessed with amazing insight. If you own no other Atta, own this
Live in San Francisco | a perfect near echo of the 1976 Showtime concert at the same venue, augmented by the addition of Vigilante Man which features a classic Ry solo, and a couple of other additions. Whether old or new, the band plays with profound respect for the music, each other and those fallen along the way. A treasure of pleasure for any Cooder fan.

Heartrending as only the most authentic hawaiian music can be. What a glorious legacy from that dispossessed people.
I was excited to find this "brown album" in print. I was shocked when my order arrived and a totally different collection-of Gabby's, was sent instead. Brown album has 16 tracks, the one I received had 14. I'm returning the collection. Sad :( October 11, 2011 UPDATE: I took a chance and ordered a 2nd time & VERY THRILLED to be holding the Brown album as described!!! Thank YOU!!
CLASSIC HAWAII MUST
I've always loved this recording. Friend sent it to me when it first came out in the early seventies. I think, however, it has gained in importance since then.But I'd also like to see the two older Hula Records' Gabby Pahinui with the Sons of Hawaii reissued in their entirety. Also the Dave Guard recording, some of which have come out on one or another collection as well. They came out in the early 60's, possibly the late 50's.
Real, traditional Hawaiian music has a beauty that is hard to describe and transports you to some of the more beautiful spots of your soul. Buy this CD.

Martina | For most of my life, I've primarily been an R&B fan and, regrettably, have never been too enamored of country music. However, several years ago, I was blown away by the captivating vocal talents of both LeAnn Rimes and Martina McBride, and have been a staunch fan of the two sirens ever since.Martina belongs to the exclusive pantheon of unique and exceptionally talented vocalists (including LeAnn, Luther Vandross, Amel Larrieux, Alicia Keys, and Clay Aiken) that always bring a smile to my face when I hear them sing. In fact, any of the aforementioned artists could probably release a CD featuring them singing the phone book and I'd probably buy it. :-) (OK, I'm being slightly facetious here - but only slightly.)With her eponymous CD, Martina McBride ...
Bravebird | Amel possesses consummate vocal skill - (possibly) perfect pitch, an impressive range, and a soulful richness to her voice - and her talents as a vocalist and songwriter have never been more apparent than they are on this CD. Amel and Alicia Keys are now in a dead heat for the title of my favorite female R&B or nu soul singer!5 Stars!
Full Circle | This album boasts absolutely sick flows coupled with insane beats. What more can a hip-hop fan ask for?Hiero is easily one of the world's dopest hip-hop crews; nearly every member is a slick-as-hell lyricist and a dope producer. Pick up this album, as well its predecessor, Third Eye Vision, for some bangin' hip-hop that's a nice change of pace from all the "bang-bang shoot 'em-up" dumb-hop that's been permeating the airwaves for the last decade.
Groove Theory | Amel's glorious vocals and Bryce's phat beats combined in '95 to make this album an instant classic. To this day, &quot;Tell Me&quot; will get just about any R&amp;B, nu soul, or hip-hop fan open when they hear it, and truthfully, I enjoyed many songs from the album as much as I did &quot;Tell Me.&quot;
Gold Coast | Great tracks - several haunting and beautiful melodies are present on this CD. Unfortunately, however, Rhian's vocal talents simply aren't impressive enough for my tastes; she doesn't exhibit much range on this disc. While she sounds somehat like Sade, ostensibly, Sade's vocal talent far surpasses Rhian's. Perhaps the chanteuse will prove me wrong on her next album by stretching herself more vocally.

Martina's songs speak volumes and this CD is truly a must-have. It is everything a greatest hits record should be - all of her biggest hits (where is &quot;It's my Time&quot;???) neatly packaged, along with a handful of new songs. Martina and producer Paul Worley offer cut-by-cut comments as well.The new material is just incredible! &quot;Blessed&quot; (written by Troy Verges), reunites Martina with former backup singer Carolyn Dawn Johnson, who just 'makes' the track. The CD version of &quot;God Fearin' Women&quot; is longer than most radio stations played and well worth the price of the CD for the intro. &quot;Concrete Angel&quot; is the story of a little girl lost and is akin to John Michael Montgomery's &quot;The Little Girl&quot;. &quot;Where Would You Be&quot; is a Martina trademark ...
I knew I would like this CD, having heard most of the songs, like the emotional &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Safe In The Arms Of Love&quot; the ballad &quot;Valentine&quot; the sweet &quot;Happy Girl&quot; and the song I heard off the movie &quot;Where The Heart Is&quot;, the song &quot;There You Are&quot;. All these songs, and more, are what Martina is famous for! Keep going Martina, you have a loyal fan in me!
Fantastic CD! Martina has a range that is unmatched in any type of music. Toss in the blue eyes and you have one heck of a musician!
I am never satisfied with &quot;hits&quot; packages from my favorite artists! There are always songs not included that I feel should have been. This one is no exception, but barely! I feel the collection would have been a more rounded overview of the last decade of McBride's music if she would have included at least one or two songs from her critically acclaimed debut album. The songs might not have been top ten hits, but &quot;The Time Has Come&quot; and &quot;Cheap Whiskey&quot; (my absolute favorite!) were video staples on CMT and TNN before she was a star. Also, it would have showed the overall growth of the artist better! Other than that minor complaint, Martina McBride's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is way above average, with the positives outweighing the ...
Picking the best Martina McBride songs must be like picking which child you love most; there is simply no such thing as a bad Martina recording.Blessed with the most unbelievable beautiful voice in music today, Martina has become known for her powerful yet delicate delivery and her songs with a message of strength and empowerment. The collection provides a wonderful overview of Martina's strengths for the casual fan, and a powerful punch for the dedicated follower of her music.First, as indicated, every Martina hit from the past decade is included, with commentary from Martina in the liner notes. From the signature &quot;Independence Day&quot; to the haunting &quot;A Broken Wing,&quot; you'll find flawless vocal performances punctuated with lyrics that reflect a woman who has a strong sense of ...

Cosmic Thing | Following the tragic loss of guitarist/composer/lyricist Ricky Wilson in October, 1985 shortly before the release of the B-52's fifth album &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot;, it was not clear whether the surviving four members of the B-52's (sister Cindy Wilson, Kate Pierson, Keith Strickland and Fred Schneider) would ever perform or record another album together again. Thankfully, in 1988, they decided to record a sixth album entitled &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;, and it became their most successful album to date and established the B-52's as the world's best party band of all time. It was also the first album in which Keith played the guitar, having given up the drums in order to learn how to reproduce Ricky's signature sound. The very danceable and fun songs in &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; include:1. ...
The End of All Things to Come Explicit Lyrics | On the heals of their very successful previous album "L.D. 50" with its hit song "Dig", Mudvayne produced an even more powerful heavy/nu-metal album with "The End of All Things to Come". Mudvayne's four members call themselves Chüd (vocals), Güüd (guitars & vocals), Spüg (percussion) and Rü-d (bass). "The End of All Things to Come" clearly illustrates Mudvayne's maturity and improved musicianship over their previous two albums. My ratings for each of the songs are below:1. "Silenced" 5/5. Heavy & aggressive guitar/percussion with screaming vocals all the way. One of the heaviest songs on the album.2. "Trapped in the Wake of a Dream" 5/5. Eclectic mix of screaming/melodic vocals backed with aggressive to heavy guitar/percussion; overall a very heavy song.3. "Not Falling" 5+/5. Very reminiscent to the ...
Skeletons | Out of Washington D.C., Nothingface's latest album "Skeletons" clearly demonstrates a broad increase in range and musicianship for the band since their last album "Violence", which was also a great album. Stylistically, Nothingface is reminiscent of Mudvayne, but with a unique sound of their own, that combines very aggressive & intense metal with engaging harmonies and melodies. Overall, I rate the album with 5 out of 5 stars, whose songs are angry and highly critical of organized Christian churches and policies of the current U.S. presidential administration. My individual track ratings (out of 5 stars) are listed below:1. "Machinations" (5). Begins with several seconds of very soft instruments before awakening to aggressive guitar & percussion accompanied with whispering vocals from Matthew Holt. The song then blossoms with ...
Believe Explicit Lyrics | The first time that I ever heard Disturbed was when I saw their video for the song &quot;Voices&quot; from their debut album &quot;The Sickness&quot; on the now defunct cable channel MTVX. From that time on, I was totally hooked on the haunting and dynamic voice of David Draiman. In their latest work &quot;Believe&quot;, frontman David Draiman and the three other members of Disturbed have grown far beyond what they achieved in their first album. David continues his trademark barks &amp; grunts as well as his unique vocals, but his increased dynamic range and melodic skills are far more polished. Along with David, the other band members (Dan Donegon, Mike Wengren and Fuzz) demonstrate improved musicianship and maturity as a group.Like their stellar, debut album &quot;The Sickness&quot;, the ...
The Sickness | Disturbed's debut album "The Sickness" put the band on the map with the songs "Stupify" and "Down with the Sickness". Inspired by metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Metallica and Judas Priest, Disturbed has created a unique sound both instrumentally and vocally with the haunting voice of David Draiman. David's trademark animalistic grunts and barks don't appeal to everyone, but are only one of the band's unique qualities, which include Dan Donegan's guitar playing and the bass as played by Fuzz. Mike Wegren does a superior job on the drums.Though the album falters a bit in the second half of the tracks, overall the album is a powerful nu-metal statement. I rank the each song on the album as follows:1. "Voices" (5/5) Fast and aggressive, highlighting David's ...

While this late 80s foray is not without its problems, many of which were due to Ricky Wilson's premature passing, I'm left with the impression that the band's grief over his death gives soul and depth to two of the album's most stellar cuts: "Ain't it a Shame?" and the achingly lovely "She Brakes for Rainbows.""Whammy" the previous LP, was not my cup of tea, and my interests were veering away from the vibe that had made the first two B albums from 79 and 80 some of my favorite vinyl on the planet. For some reason I picked up this cassette that Spring of '87 on a car trip back from Tucson to L.A. and found myself transported. I think I played "She Brakes for Rainbows" ...
This effort was not filled with a bunch of &quot;silly&quot; songs, hence alot of zombies dont get it. But I recomend you to get it and enjoy a wonderful cd.
This is a classic B-52's album and one that I think is still underrated. It's my favorite of all their albums to date. &quot;Summer Of Love&quot; captures the early 80's spirit and I think really transcends most of their other work, including Cosmic Thing. &quot;Ain't It A Shame&quot; is a classic B-52's trailer trash ballad. I can still remember every word. And &quot;Communicate&quot; is classic B-52's techno. The B-52's had a wide range of sounds in the late 70's and especially the early 80's and this album displays that range in the best light, I think of any other album.
After Whammy!, which showed the cracks beginning to show, along came the followup, Bouncing Off The Satellites, in which the Athens group's sound became watered down. Even the orange popsicles and lemonade of "Summer Of Love" doesn't help. As an opening song, it's weak.The pace picks up with "Girl From Ipanema Goes To Greenland." It's wonderful to hear two songs in a row sung totally by the ladies, but it's jarring to hear none of the expected accompanied commentary from Fred Schneider. It's more radio-friendly, but with diluted energy, with none of the wackiness or frenetic energy of "Rock Lobster" or "My Own Private Idaho."The protagonist in "Housework" is clearly not one of these emancipated women we hear so much about. I picture a traditional housewife like ...
B-52's albums released in the mid-80s don't exactly tickle my fancy at all, since they'd pretty much abandoned their original sound and hadn't yet come upon that overproduced late-decade Nile Rodgers dance sound which became so infectious (and so chartworthy). This isn't really an exception, though it shows the band moving away from the dull cheese-fest &quot;Whammy!&quot; into a collection of actual songs. I give the band credit for the gorgeous pop of &quot;Summer Of Love&quot; and &quot;Ain't It A Shame,&quot; and the bizarre synth excursions of &quot;Detour Thru Your Mind&quot; and &quot;Girl From Ipanema Goes To Greenland,&quot; but the rest of the album is basically a studio mess (&quot;Housework&quot;? Give me a break), not helped at all by the death of Ricky Wilson. Most of the ...

Target: In 1985, one of the B-52's key members, composer/lyricist/guitarist Ricky Wilson, was suffering from complications resulting from HIV and AIDS.  Unfortunately, with no adequate treatments for HIV in 1985, Ricky passed away in October of that year not long after he and his band mates (sister Cindy Wilson, Fred Schneider, Kate Pierson and Keith Strickland) had completed recording the album entitled &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot;, which was released a few months later in 1986.  While grieving Ricky's loss and lacking Ricky's unique guitar sound, the four surviving members of the B-52's decided to not go on a concert tour to promote the album.  Sadly, this album, which was dedicated to Ricky's memory, quickly went into obscurity and many people speculated whether it marked the end of the B-52's.  Fortunately, the four surviving members regrouped a few years later and recorded their most commercially successful album, &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;, in 1989; but Ricky's final album continues to this day to be least known B-52's album.<br />The ten songs of &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot;, which total nearly 46 minutes of play time, are rather good overall in spite of several negative critiques written about the album shortly after its release in 1986.  It also features rare vocals by Keith and Ricky.  I rate each of the album's ten songs as follows:<br />1. &quot;Summer Of Love&quot;  (5 stars, sung by Kate &amp; Cindy).  Fun &amp; danceable song praising the fun and heat of the summer.  This song was used in the soundtrack of the 1989 film &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;.<br />2. &quot;Girl From Ipanema Goes to Greenland&quot; (5 stars, Sung by Cindy).  A fun tribute to the well known jazzy 1960's song &quot;Garota De Ipanema&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Girl From Ipanema&quot;) by Stan Getz And Joao Gilberto.  Ipanema is a well-known beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.<br />3. &quot;Housework&quot; (4.5 stars, sung by Kate).  A fun tribute to the toils of housework and wanting a man to help clean.<br />4. &quot;Detour Through Your Mind&quot; (5 stars, sung by Fred, Cindy &amp; Kate).  A fast &amp; fun internalized trip through the mind and visiting a doctor.<br />5. &quot;Wig&quot; (4.5 stars, sung by Fred, Cindy &amp; Kate).  A fast &amp; fun tribute to various wigs, which were often a trademark part of the B-52's performing costumes.<br />6. &quot;Theme for a Nude Beach&quot; (5 stars, sung by Fred, Cindy, Kate, Keith &amp; Ricky). One of the very few songs sung by all 5 B-52's members, this fun song with beautiful harmonic vocals praises the joys of being on a nude beach.<br />7. &quot;Ain't It a Shame&quot; (5+ stars, sung by Cindy, Keith &amp; Ricky).  This sad, but beautiful, love song is one of the few with Ricky &amp; Keith singing and is probably the only one with this combination of vocals in the B-52's repetoire.<br />8. &quot;Juicy Jungle&quot; (4 stars, sung by Fred &amp; John Coté).  A fast &amp; danceable song praising the environment and nature, as well as protecting the rain forests of the world.<br />9. &quot;Communicate&quot; (4.5 stars, sung by Fred, Cindy &amp; Kate).  A fast song encouraging people to talk to prevent arguments.<br />10. &quot;She Brakes For Rainbows&quot; (5 stars, sung by Cindy, Ricky, Keith &amp; Kate).  Mostly a beautiful solo for Cindy that I would love to hear performed live.<br />Whether or not you are a diehard B-52's fan, this is a wonderful album that has truly been very under appreciated since it was recorded 18 years ago.  Overall, I rate the B-52's album &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot; with a very-well deserved 5 stars and highly recommend it to every B-52's fan, especially to those fans who have never heard all of its songs.

Output: Reviewer: Disturbed's debut album "The Sickness" put the band on the map with the songs "Stupify" and "Down with the Sickness"

Everything But the Girl's girl's latest solo bravely ventures into territory assiduously avoided in our youth-obsessed culture: love in the middle ages. That can be a touchy subject, but Thorn's thorny mournings go down easy, couched as they are in comfortable melodies. "Oh, the Divorces!" is a speculation on who's next; "Singles Bar" explores the same question in a very different context. The punchy "Hormones" wryly laments the generational differences in biological clocks. The highlight is "Late in the Afternoon," a beautiful, bittersweet, multi-layered observation on the seasons of love. This is not an album for the millennials, unless they're interested in what makes Mum's clock tick.
Everything But The Girl vocalist Tracey Thorn is back with her third solo album "Love and its opposite", based she says on real life after the age of 40; Moribund relationships, divorce, getting back on the dating scene, etc. There are no electronic Dance songs like "Grand canyon" "Falling off a log", or "It's all true" this time around which I missed at first, but the songs here are very strong, warm and intimate.Opening is the gentle piano/string ballad "Oh, the divorces!", followed by the acoustic ballad "Long white dress" with percussion building in halfway through."Hormones" is sunny Pop/Rock with a light Country feel, followed by the brilliant haunting ballad "Kentish town" with lovely harmonies. "Why does the wind?" is beautiful Pop/Soul, the type George Michael used ...
Here is an unexpected and unique CD from Tracey Thorn. Not that fans wouldn't expect a literate and gorgeously sung record but this leaves her without comparisons this year. Taking on adult themes of her fans and peers now in our 40's, she has created one of the best records of the year. Late In the Afternoon is my favorite song on the CD because it combines all the elements that make Thorn such a great artist. Other stand out tracks are Swimming and Why Does the Wind.
WOW!! As a long time and very devoted fan of EBTG, I have really missed the sound of their voices and their music. This really hits the spot, and it's about time. I wish that the two of them would do another album, but this is just as good. What a BEAUTIFUL album and that voice, OMG! she just gets better and better as time goes on. Oh, The Divorces is the perfect opener to a perfect collection of music. If you are a big fan of the early EBTG, you will love this CD. This has a great mix of music for everyones taste. A few up-tempo numbers to show that she still has her groove- on and her ballads are true "Tracey Thorn". Come on ...
Fantastic. Realistic relationships set to music. If you're tired of all the pie-in-the-ski-I'm-only-half-a-person-without you crap on the radio and in much of popular music, here's the album for you. Real life set to music.

A Covent Garden Class | I teach senior exercise classes part of which is based on my ballet training. I found this disk to be a delightful addition for our barre work. A nice variety of selections. Even the seniors who don't care for classical music are enjoying the music. Thanks for making this one. It's a winner.
Music for Ballet Class Vol. 6 | I purchased this disk to be used with senior exercise classes. It is a ballet class disk and will be very helpful for advanced classes. The tempos are mostly fast and the music is heavy. I haven't found it to be useful for my classes, but then I'm not teaching a real ballet class.

Then the big surprise was in the extra material - Shanendoah sung by the firelight in woods by a stream. It just doesn't get any better than that! The backstage footage provides a real sense of the performer and the work that goes into such a fine performance. Thanks Bryn!!
