Disposable Shower Cap, Elastic Bath Cap,Waterproof Hair Head Cover Shower Cap For Home Use,Hotel and Beauty Salon,Pack of 120 （Blue) | This single layer thin blue shower disposable shower caps are tiny. They are really for a kids head. I can barely get my hair into this. There are 120 (I did not count them) tiny blue slivers that have to be unraveled. Since they are so small, these would work best to cover the tops of small serving bowls during a picnic to keep the flies away. These are functional but I am not impressed. | 3.0
The Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine | I wish I could wear these colors but most of them are too deeply hued for my fair complexion. I tried several of the colors and many make my eyes look swollen and puffy as if I had an eye infection. If I had olive or brown skin, I think these colors would look awesome. The only colors I was able to wear in this pallet are the pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. I absolutely love the shimmer on many of these. I like that the "compact pallet holder" has a magnetic closure. Eye applicators have to be purchased separately. Despite this, I think $7.88 is a great price for this selection. The colors that I did apply stayed put all day.<br /><br />The 15 ... | 4.0
Folie for Women EDP - Eau De Parfum 100ml(3.4 oz) | Saffron, Red Fruits, Hedione, Jasmine, Moss, Amber | Perfume, Perfumes for women, Women's fragrances, Fragrance, Womens perfume | by Intense Elite | I wish I loved this. This is a nicely packaged perfume in an attractive bottle with a gold-colored tassel hanging from the side. The scent is neither offensive nor enticing. I can't even describe what it smells like. It is so very subtle but it lasts a few hours.<br /><br />The current price of $44.99 ($49.99 minus $5) is competitively priced for perfume like this but it is not one I would order again as I have to really love it to pay that much. | 3.0
ikikin Body Brush Soft Silicone Bath brush Exfoliating Body Scrub Brush, Shower Cleansing Scrubber Brush for Double-Sided Silicone Sponge Bath Brush with Soft Brush pink+blue | There are two body brushes in this package (pastel blue and quartz pink). Each one has a silicone sleeve into which a soft sponge has been inserted. The sleeve has a loop for hanging, nubbs on one side for scrubbing, and various small ridges on the other side for light scrubbing.<br /><br />I used the pink one in my pink bathroom; it matches perfectly. I showered with it and it holds the suds well. I personally like the nubbed side because it is like getting a massage while washing. My favorite bath "sponge" is actually a body puff (those with the netting material) because they lather up well. This "brush" is now my second favorite. If the suds were prolific with this "brush" like the body puffs ... | 4.0

These brushes were absolutely beautiful and very soft but I did return them. Most of the brushes are the same exact size. I was looking for eyeshadow brushes more so than face brushes. I could’ve looked at the pictures a little bit closer to see that the kit only came with bigger brushes. No big deal but if you were looking for big brushes this is definitely a kit to buy! | 3.0
I love the design and the brushes are very soft! The bag that the come in will be perfect for travel! | 5.0
This is a nice set of brushes. The brush is a soft pink synthetic fiber. The handles are a pinkish crystal handle. The brushes come in a clear plastic bag that closes to store your brushes. | 5.0
Brushes are super cute! I love the matching traveling case. The brushes came individually wrapped and are really soft and blends well. Great buy! | 5.0

[[VIDEOID:c99a2299e0c56e287829c35eaa7f9cd]] I was super upset because the shipping was so messed up and I only got 1 set but was charged for 2. After speaking to CS i got a refund. The bottom half are the 6/60/6 and the top is a different brand since i never got my 2and set. I do love them tho! Very soft and easy to manage! | 5.0

Mererke_Pretty Nurtured Argan Oil (1.7oz) | My middle daughter has thicker hair, so I use this product on her. After she washes her hair she applies this serum. Her hair have 3 colors in them naturally, darker brown, lighter brown and red. When she applies this oil her classmates thought that she dyed her hair! It just bring so much shine and compliment her hair. After seeing that effect I applied it on my fine hair. I have highlights. It brings the different color in my hair as well. My co-workers thought that I just visited a hairdresser. So, I would suggest it for anyone. I do not use conditioner when I use the product. I received this serum discounted during promo period to test and review. | 5.0
Anti Aging Eye Wrinkle Cream for Women & Men with Hyaluronic Acid Matrixyl 3000 Complex to Moisturize Your Skin Day And Night – 1.8 Fl. Oz | The whole summer I was kind of slacking off on my eye cream. Now it is time to re-start on my &#34;beauty regimen&#34; again. I was pleasently surprised that the jar was a decent size, not a tiny one. Here are my pros and cons:<br />Pros:<br />1. Ingredients are natural, in harmony with my skin<br />2. Nice, light smell<br />3.Only need a small amount, so it will last long time<br />4. Decent price<br />5. Improvement in fine wrinkles around my eyes<br />Cons: none so far. If I encounter any, I will update my review. I have been using it for solid 10 days and now I am sharing the jar with my mom as well. She love it, too. May be i will get her her own ... | 5.0
InstaNatural Cellulite Cream - With Caffeine & Retinol - Body Firming Solution & Tightening Lotion for Thigh Area, Buttocks & More - No Wrap Needed - Anti Cellulite Control Treatment - 4 OZ | To help this cream to work on my abdomen I also purchased detox tea and a waist trainer. I drink my tea, which helps me to get rid of bloating, I apply my Cellulite Cream, let it absorb, then I Put on my t-shirt and put my waist trainer on top. The waist trainer helps to keep my abdomen warm and triggers the ingredients in a cream (caffeine, retinol, Vitamin C as well as many other ingredients) to star working better. That is my personal suggestion and you can apply it for yourself. I also apply it on my neck 2x day as well.<br />I received this cream with a discount for trying, testing and reviewing | 5.0
Anti Aging Skin Care Serum for Men & Women From Uptown Cosmeceuticals Offers Spin Trap® Intelligent Antioxidant, Advanced Scientific Formula Promotes Younger Looking Face, 30mL | Since I received this serum with a great discount I shared this skin care product with my friend , so she could provide her opinion.<br />She used it for several day and that's what she found out:<br />1. Nice, presentable packaging and good design.<br />2. Very pleasant scent (citrus and spring flowers kind) very fresh<br />3. Hypoallergenic (she has EXTREMELY sensitive skin)<br />4. Her husband tried it and stated that is helped him with pores<br /> I could add to that that the package arrived very fast and even the full price with the discount is acceptable compare to other serums from the mall. | 5.0

You'll be amazed by how cheap products can get, I am pretty sure except for one nail cutter, none of them are usable. Especially you should see the scissors, OMG they are the cheapest thing mankind has ever seen. And the fake reviews are killing Amazon. Stay away from it. I am not returning anything because the more your return on Amazon, more your record gets bad and eventually you'll be booted. | 1.0

1513 by LA LA LEAF - All Natural Facial Cream, 750mg Quick Absorbing Hemp Moisturizer with Rosehip, Carrot Seed and Provitamin B5 - Smooths Wrinkles for Firm Glowing Skin - Paraben-free, Cruelty-free, Vegan | I don’t think I could use it consistently on my face but, this helps my often super dry Neck to look healthier and more youthful. I’ve used a little bit in the morning and at night and it’s helping. It’s thick enough but, it spreads out quite easily.<br /> It’s alsoPublish their Lab Testing for its quality and Guarantee it.<br /> Enjoy!😁 | 4.0
RUGGED & DAPPER Active Regimen Grooming and Skincare Set for Men | Includes Body Wash Shampoo + Face Wash + Facial Moisturizer + Shaving Cream in a Travel Bag | This Set comes looking pretty classy in its packaging. It also comes with its own matching black tote and the handle on it makes it easy to carry or hang it for storage, which is exactly what I’ve done. I’ve never heard of this company but, I don’t know much about current fashion names anyway so, that’s not saying much.😁<br /> I can easily say that I think the scents are really nice, not too strong for my senses and it’s definitely something I would appreciate as a gift with Class.<br /> Stay Healthy Everyone!😁 | 5.0
DeepDream Portable Electric Nail Drill - Professional Efile Nail Drill Kit For Acrylic, Gel Nails, Manicure Pedicure Polishing Shape Tools with 11Pcs Nail Drill Bits and 36 Sanding Bands | I thought it was a wireless model but, for it not being one, it’s quite a bit thinner than one with a battery in it and it’s lightweight. It’s made of metal and it comes with a decent amount of different grinding tips and sander roles. The control is simple, works well and it’s powerful enough to to a good job. I’d definitely recommend it.<br /> Stay Healthy Everyone!😁 | 5.0
Glass spray bottle-16 ounce empty bottle ounce refillable container 2 packs, suitable for essential oils, cleaning products, aromatherapy, water mist plants with mist and air flow settings | These arrived quickly and in perfect order. The sprayers work well and the set comes with 2 nice Caps to fully seal them, if needed and even a little Funnel to make a clean fill. I think they’re pretty decent and would definitely recommend. | 4.0

This is a complete set for doing manicures or pedicures and even a couple for extra things like maybe for your face. All the tools are strong amd sturdy. The case unfortunately is not as strong. The straps that hold the implements in the case are weak and thin and one broke right away. Overall a good set they definitely thought of everything to include in the kit. | 4.0
This is a fantastic kit. I am really happy with the quality of the materials and the overall aesthetic. Worth it! | 5.0
This is a mediocre set. It isnt especially bad nor good. The scissor blades don't meet in the middle so they dont cut very well. One set of nail clippers has a weird angle and leaves ridges on the surface of the nail. The other does a better job but for some reason launches the pieces of nail far away - not great for keeping the house tidy. The case doesnt stay shut.<br /><br />Overall, most of the pieces work they just dont do a great job. I'd have preferred a simpler set with fewer pieces of better quality. | 3.0
Totally worth it for the price | 5.0

Emilia Hypoallergenic Bath Oil for Babies - Paraben-Free Natural Baby Wash Enriched With Natural Oat Extract, Sunflower, Sweet Almond, Sesame, Calendula, and Chamomile 8.5 fl.oz. | I tried out this baby oil and I love it.

It is for massaging the face and blood circulation. There are instructions to tell you how to do it.<br /><br />The Jades are a very beautiful color. And the kit comes with a little bag that is a VERY beautiful shade of green. So beautiful, I wanted to eat it up. (Those of you who know me know that I am a color person). I knew that green was my second favorite color. If red/pink didn't already fill the spot of my favorite color, then this shade of green would be it. Third favorite color is a tie between purple and orange. | 5.0

Yardley Naturally Moisturizing Bar, Early Morning Rose 4.25 oz Each (3 Pack) | Rose is my all-time favorite scent. I know, I'm probably in the minority, because most people I know do not like rose scent, and they say it is "old-ladyish". I love the scent of rose. I have always loved it. Even if it puts me in the "old-lady" category, I don't care. I've loved it since I was a child, and I will never quit loving it. To me, it smells heavenly. I would love it if my whole house and yard smelled like roses.<br /><br />This rose-scented soap is awesome. The smell is awesome, of course, and it also lathers up nicely. It is good-quality soap, the scent, the texture, the lather, the cleansing qualities, everything about it is awesome.<br /><br />I've had other rose-scented soaps ... | 5.0

Love the packaging on this super fun and girly bubble mask! This mask was perfect for relaxing after a long day - it was very soothing. I have tried a lot of different types of bubble masks and this one was just as good as any others I had tried. I wish I could have just rubbed the bubbles in like a moisturizer instead of having to rinse off, but overall I liked it. | 4.0
I was expecting some larger bubbles than this mask gave me. I kept it on a bit longer than the recommended 3 minutes to see if the bubbles would get any larger, but they didn't. I think it worked well, but I think that the gimmick isn't worth what you get. My face felt pretty good afterward, but it wasn't anything special. This may be cooler to a younger demographic, but I would not get this again. | 4.0
I got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter, I will update the review once she uses it if we see any irritation or issues with it. She loves these mask so I'm always trying to find some different ones we haven't tried before. | 5.0
My skin can sometimes flare with dryness and redness. This mask was able to reduce both in one application. The solution is mild and gentle enough that it didn't sting even my sensitive skin. The fragrance wasn't too strong and the mask was thick, but not too heavy through the treatment. It left my face feeling refreshed and relaxed. I wish I had another on hand. | 5.0

AILIBOTE Samsung Galaxy S10e Screen Protector, [3 Pack] 9H Hardness Anti-Scratch Full Coverage Tempered Glass Screen Protector Film for Samsung73 | I have pink undertones in my skin as opposed to yellow so this balances out my makeup . If it’s too light it darkens it . If it’s too dark it lightens it . I would like it if it wasn’t so dry or maybe if they would add some dimethacone to it to make it more moist . My skin is dry and I always have to set the makeup with a spray to moisten it back after the foundation and powder is on .. love it and it’s inexpensive | 5.0

ModelCo Contour Stick | Medium-Dark Matte Bronze | I Really have liked this as a contour . Unfortunately I got the first time I used it way back when as a sample in a bag and I thought it was a lipstick and I loved the color and then saw its contour and used it as contour for under the chin and for the cheek hollows or to carve out your cheeks . It blends and stays all day and many other reviews adds it makes a great lipstick too. | 4.0
12 Classic Color Elegant Blush Set | This is good quality makeup... My only dislike of the palettes is that there are more orange and peach like colors.. If you like them... Then this would be a good palette for you.. I really like more pinky colors but it is a good palette. | 3.0

To me this was a total waste of money. I put them on, watched a movie and by the time I went to bed they were loose and I ended up peeling them off. I really don't think they would stay on for any length of time, certainly not for an important event. Just wasn't for me | 1.0
I love these nails, they look natural and hold up well. Very pretty color | 5.0

Willie Morrow Eze-teze (Styling Comb) in Assorted Colors (Green & Orange) | [[VIDEOID:50c6456a14894703519e5e34115f6021]] I really like Willie Morrows products and this comb is excellent. I love to use this type of comb when I'm doing relaxers or Jerry curls. The loop is good for taking a section of the hair when it's in a base. The back of the Cove is good to smooth out the back of the head and the sides. I recommend this comb. I think you'd get a better deal when you buy the three black ones because when you buy this one you pay half the amount of the comb to ship which is not hip. Thank you for looking at my review and God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life. Baba Oran Z | 5.0
BVENDANO 10×10gm Face Paint Kit One Stroke Split Cake Water Based Palette with 3 Professional Brushes Body Paint Makeup Birthday Party Halloween | With this kit you get more than just face paint painting cakes, you also get 3 professional brushes.

The one drawback I find with this kit is that the three colors in each cake can sometimes affects you do not want, be careful not to get a color you do not want while trying to get one color out of the cakes that have three colors in it.

These are great for parties. It has a lot of colors. It is very nice to give a cute look. They went on well. It wasn't too difficult to apply. They looked good. The kids really enjoyed them. They would be good for a party or Halloween. They were lots of fun. I would recommend them. | 5.0
Easily wiped off, if you want it to last longer using a makeup setting spray. One of the pallets came broken on the side and they were really oily. But they did stand out in color well, if using multiple colors be patient and let dry so you don't run colors. | 3.0

Canlierr 6 Pieces Simple Metal U Shaped Hair Pin French Style Hairpins Fork Sticks 2 Prong Updo Chignon Pins Hair Accessories for Long Hair Women Girls (Pink, Blue, Gold, Silver) | Solid product. Can’t wait to slink it up in my hair with diff dos. Would have given 5 stars but for the fact I ordered the bright multicolor set photographed as blue, pink etc but I got the option with just the other set. This eCommerce switcheroo is the reason some prefer brick and mortar shopping bcos some retailers just send online shoppers anything they like and not what the image, description & order details actually state. | 3.0

NEW Challenger Men's Rinse Free Hand Wash - 1oz - Portable, 30% Alcohol Hand Wash both Cleans & Moisturizes. Hydrates Hands, Forearms, & Skin - Cleansing 30% Alc. Based Formula Washes and Nourishes | I love this stuff. It’s great during pandemic and I prefer it over the gel or wipes. | 4.0
Arswin Hair Scalp Massager Shampoo Brush,Soft Silicone Wet and Dry Double Sided & Exfoliating Back Scrubber for Face Shower Bath Body Brush for Men Women Kids with Free Adhesive Hook(Green) | This makes my head feel so good. I have my cosmetology license and one thing we learned was it is good to massage the scalp. This helps increase blood flow there and helps with hair growth. Overall, it helps the health of the scalp and hair. The brush works great for this and is also good for shampooing. If your hair is long and tangles easily it will still work but be careful not to get it stuck. | 5.0
QTMY Wide Headbands Fashion Women Baroque Crystal Gemstone Hair Accessories Head Band Fashion Headwear Hairbands for Women | This is my very favorite headband! First off, I love the pretty rhinestone pattern and sparkly colors. It’s not to big, and looks so pretty to help dress up hair or an outfit. It is very comfortable, headache free for all day wear. Very good quality. Love the suede backing underneath. It’s a princess of a headband! | 5.0
MediLift 3D Micro-filler Patch - Micro Tip Patches for Wrinkles, Fine Lines, Smile Lines 2 x 4 sets (8 pieces) | These patches are awesome. At first I was kinda skeptical and afraid to press on under eyes, but I’m so glad I tried them. They really did help to plump up my shallow under eye area. And the results lasted for a couple of days. There was no irritation. Very good quality product and works as described. I would highly recommend. | 5.0

Beautiful lashes and great magnetic eyeliner. The eyeliner is totally waterproof and lasts all day without problems. Doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes and these lashes are lightweight and totally beautiful. I have worn them a few different times and they still look beautiful. I am able to clean them gently in makeup remover and then let them dry and I can wear the lashes over and over again. | 5.0

Unny Club Black Square Lipstick (Remedy) | matte lipstick | This lipstick is so nice. I've used matte lipstick before and it made my lips feel pinched and dry. But this lipstick moisturizes my lips and makes them feel supple and soft. The color lasts a long time and love the way it looks on my lips. | 5.0
22 Inch Long Yaki Straight Ponytails Synthetic Fiber Kinky Straight Wave Ponytail Hairpieces Wrap Around With Magic Paste Curly Wavy Pony Tail Clip in Hair Extensions for Women (#2) | The ponytail felt really nice. However, it was easy to tangle up. I watched the video on the shopping page on how to put on the ponytail with the wrap around piece. The hair got stuck in the velcro and the wrap around hair is not really thick and didn't look right after I wrapped it. I ended up putting on a scrunchie and had to braid the hair while on my head to keep it from tangling up. | 2.0
Toyotress Deep Twist Crochet Hair - 12 Inch 8 Packs Natural Black Ocean Wave Crochet Braids, Short Bob Water Wave Wavy Curly Synthetic Braiding Hair Extensions (12 Inch, 1B-8P) | This was great hair to use in my crochet style. It was easy to style and very easy to maintain for about 4 weeks. I loved the length and it did stretch a little longer the longer I kept it in my hair. The blended color was great and loved how it matched my skin color. | 5.0
QIUTIMIY 18 Pack Pearl Hair Pins for Bridal Wedding Women Hair Jewelry Accessories, with Clear Container | I really love these pearl pins! I use them when I put buns/braids in my hair and it adds a really nice look to otherwise mundane hair styles. The pins are very sturdy and I don't have to worry about them moving during the day. The pearls are very nicely made and doesn't peel like some other imitation pearls tend to do. Highly recommend these pins. | 5.0

Dudulanni 24 Pcs Press on Nails Medium, Fake Nails with Nail Glue, Stick Glue on Nails False Nails Acrylic Nails for Women S Ombre Pink Almond | I like the color but they don’t really look ombre. They are thin and fit fairly well.

AJOKE Makeup Sponge Wedges,Latex Free Foam Beauty Sponge,for all kinds of cosmetics（20-count） | These sponges are a great addition to my makeup routine. The Texture is Smooth and Blends my Foundation well. I love the size too!

IS_FROM isfrom Three Blend Oil GREENERY for Soothing 1.01oz l Vegan Facial Oil for Dry Skin | I really like this blend of oils for your face and neck. It goes on nice and smooth and leaves my skin hydrated well. I love that all the ingredients are Natural, Vegan, as well as Cruelty free, all important to me! This blended oil Smells Really Good!<br /><br />I really enjoy using products that have hemp seed oil and bergamot oil. The use of hemp seed oil in this product serves as a carrier oil as well as soothes and moisturizes your skin. Bergamot helps to calm your skin as well as acts as an anti-inflammatory agent. Holy Basil is also used in this blend of oils and helps improve your skins elasticity. All three of these ingredients work well in concert with each other.<br /><br ... | 5.0
GOMAY Hydrating Amino Acid Foaming Facial Cleanser, Daily Face Wash for Makeup Remover with Face Cleansing Brush | The cleanser feels luxurious and decadent. Most cleansers leave my face feeling dry and tight but not this one! My skin feels fresh and moisturized after use.<br /><br />Having mature skin(over 50), I find most cleansers are drying but this product truly outshines others I’ve tried. I have sensitive skin and have experienced no problems whatsoever. The brush is a little stiff but I like it. You can opt to not use the brush if you prefer. Overall I am Very Pleased with this product and def recommend it. I hope this review helps! | 5.0

Both my girls have longer hair and like to get it off their neck during the hot summer months. My girls have been using these clips for a week and so far, so good. There are 8 hair clips in this package so they each took 4 clips. There are 2 styles. One style is curved teeth clips while the other is more a rectangle with teeth. The girls have tried both styles and they say both work well. Only time will tell us if these clips will last but at under $10 for 8 clips who cares. Both girls are happy with the style, colors and cost. | 5.0

lilah b. - Bronzed Beauty Bronzer Duo - b. sunkissed - Multipurpose Bronzer Duo to Highlight + Contour and Blend | Let me start off by saying I am fair skinned so it's hard to find a bronzer that doesn't look so harsh with my complexion. This was offered to me to try in return for an honest review. So, upon first getting this - it was relatively heavy for just a bronzer/highlight. When I got the duo out, I realized why. The packaging that the actual bronzer/highlight is in is made of some heavy glass like material. It's packaged really pretty though. There's not a lot of product that comes in the container. But, you get a beautiful golden bronzer and a peachy highlight. The bronzer actually looks very natural on my fair skin. It's not harsh or orange. It looks like a natural shadow on my ... | 4.0
YoungSee 20inch Tape in Hair Extensions Remy Human Hair Balayage Ombre Darkest Brown to Medium Brown with Ash Blonde Straight Tape Hair Extensions 20pcs/50g | These are my first ever time trying extensions. The color is pretty accurate to my own hair. They are very soft as they should be since they’re real human hair. I got the 20 pc. I wasn’t sure that would be enough for me as I have medium thickness hair that’s a couple inches past my shoulders. I definitely need at least 2 more packs to fill in the rest of my hair. If you have thinner hair, you may get away with needing less. These haven’t shed too much either. I’ve not yet applied heat to them so I can’t attest to how well they’ll hold a curl. I’ll order a few more packs to fill in the rest of my hair and then try to ... | 5.0
KISSIO Eyebrow Stamp Stencil and Eyebrow Styling Gel Kit (03#Clear) | I don’t quite have full brows - they’re kind of sparse but recently I’ve been trying the soap brow trend and filling in the brow with some pomade. This gel works well, I don’t have much of an issue with the brush it came with. I also don’t always do soap brows so the brush doesn’t get a lot of buildup and I also kind of clean the residue with a makeup wipe. The gel holds up fine, I have frequent hot flashes so sometimes it feels a bit icky but overall it’s fine. I will say, I feel it’s a bit overpriced for what it is. It’s listed at $14 currently and I just feel that’s a bit too much for this. | 4.0
Keratin Secrets Keratin Infused Shampoo and Conditioner Duo 12 Ounce | I’ve heard of Keratin treatments and that its supposedly good for your hair. So, I figured I’d give this combo a try. First off, it’s hard to squeeze the shampoo out of the bottle, even more so when your hands are wet. That was frustrating. The conditioner comes in a pump and it’s much too thick for the small pump thus making it hard to get out. Thirdly, these do not smell nice. They smell very bizarre and did not like that my hair smelled like it afterwards. The results of this combo were not impressive either. Especially for $50! My $20 combo works so much better than this shampoo and conditioner. I am bummed that this was not better. I could’ve gotten past the weird smell ... | 1.0

This is the best makeup wipe I have ever had! You put it under hot water for 10 seconds and wipe your eyes and all of the makeup comes off! There is little to no residue the next day either. The cloth is so soft and washes easily as well. So much better than drippy liquids, or expensive wipes. Love it! | 5.0
I LOVE makeup removing cloths. I don't use them solo — only with a makeup remover or micellar water. But these things are great because they're gentle on your skin and are far more economical and environmentally friendly than using disposable wipes. | 5.0
My wife uses light natural make up and this worked great for her. It is a very soft towel that feels soothing on your skin as you wash off you make up at the end of the day. It washed clean again after using light natural make up. I don’t know how it would work on heavier make up, but it might not wash clean as easily. | 5.0

Elbahya Natural Hair Repair Serum - Curly Treatment for Damaged Hair with Moroccan Argan Oil and Shea Butter Serum, for all Hair Types | I gave this to my daughter, who is going to be extra careful due to the broken top. If it goes on the side, it is going to leak and that was before I unwrapped the package. My daughter loves argan oil so she is going to use it rather than me throw it away. | 3.0
naissance Certified Organic Prickly Pear Cactus Oil (Barbary Fig Seed Oil) 1 fl oz Pure & Natural, Cold Pressed, Vegan, Hexane Free, Non GMO | When I first put it on my face, it felt so thick and I started thinking this was going to be way to thick and heavy feeling But it is absorbing into my skin quite well. The product is unscented but the natural scent of the oil kind of smells like old olive oil. But that smell goes away too. | 5.0
Jade Rose Quartz Roller for Face 2 in 1 Gua Sha Set Including Rose Quartz Roller and Jade Face Massager 100% Real Natural Jade Facial Roller Anti Aging Face Roller Massager by Rayfarmo | I am wearing a facial mask right now and I used this tool to help get it all spread out and when I remove the mask, I will be using the tool again to get the product left on my face worked in.

I fell in love with Easydew products awhile back. I do tend to use and try all sorts of products, but I have a short list of products that I really like for me. Easydew is on that list. Easydew is also a brand I trust. I just sense that it is doing what it says it is going to do. Budget friendly too. They dont use frilly words and overinflated promises. They just seem straightforward with science backed ingredients. I like that a lot. I think all or most of their products include EGF (epidermal growth factors) which I am keen on for skin repair and health.<br />I haven't used an easydew product yet that I didnt like or love.

Sand & Sky Face Roller & Massager Tool. Aussie Skincare Essentials Firming Face Roller, Sculpt, Sooth & Contour to Banish Puffiness and Boost Serum Absorption. | I don't like a lot of facial massagers but LOVED this one. First of all, it is gorgeous with the pink ombre on silver. It has a good weight to it and is easy to grasp. The angle makes it so that when you are rolling it almost creates a pinching effect. It also feels cool on the face, with or without any lotion/serum. You can make it even cooler by storing it in the fridge prior to use. I also had some tightness in my neck area and it worked great as a massager too. Very good quality roller, this is one I highly recommend! | 5.0
HAYEJIN Korea Blessing of Sprout Vitality Cream - Vegan, Curelty free(All Skin Type) , 50ml/1.69 fl.oz | It took me a while to try this out and I finally was able to. When I opened it, at first I thought the cream went bad. The texture just looked different. Usually face creams look smooth but this had almost a goopy look before even putting my finger into it and testing it out. I came here and noticed that everyone pretty much had the same experience and it wasn’t that my jar that went bad - so I figured it was safe to put on my skin.<br /><br />Upon applying, it is a bit tacky and sticky feeling but after rubbing it in to my skin and letting it settle, it fully absorbed into my skin.

After squeezing out the water, it stayed in the expanded shape. I used this to blend my new serum foundation, it looked flawless! I've gotten quite a few of these blenders online and these are hands down the softest and bounciest blenders I've came across.

I just love the smell of this one - especially when the smells are from oils / essential oils, and nothing synthetic. This bottle is just chock full of good stuff, good ingredients, and herbs and things. As we get into the winter season this will be perfect to keep my skin moisturized so at the moment I am using it sparingly.
