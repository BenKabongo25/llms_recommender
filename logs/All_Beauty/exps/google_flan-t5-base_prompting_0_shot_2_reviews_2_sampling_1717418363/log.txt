Philips Norelco arcitec 1060 Men's Shaving System | I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried. This review comes from much experience with the brand.<br /><br />This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs. The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don't waste money on the Cleaner accessory. It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job. It requires cleaning after each use as there is ... | 3.0

Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit,10 Pairs Eyelashes Magnetic 2021 Upgraded 3D Fluffy Natural Waterproof Reusable Fox Eyes Kit False Eyelashes And Eyeliner. | I am a huge fan of magnetic lashes in general , and these are great . These are an ideal solution to the lash dilemma many of us face. Mascara is a process to apply and still doesn’t give the dramatic results so many of us desire, regular false lashes have sticky glue to deal with and lead us to lose real lashes too. Then extensions are such a commitment. Magnetic lashes , like these especially are the solution. | 5.0
YinMer Lavish Lash – Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum with Biotin & Natural Growth Peptides for Long, Thick Lashes and Eyebrows | I love the idea of this product , have always been looking for something to promote growth in the eyelash/eyebrow area.

KISSIO Eyeshadow Set Of 9 Colors, Practical Colors, Pigmentation, Long-Lasting, Rotating Design, CHINA Style, Good Gift | This is a lovely make-up wheel. It comes with 9 colors to choose from, 5 of which are matte and the rest shimmer. The matte shadows don't cake and the shimmer ones go on smoothly and are not greasy. I like the blend of the colors in the set, they are nicely matched. I like that the colors are subtle, yet provide a good variety for you to play around with and express yourself. The wheel does spin, but only when it is closed, which is not a functional feature and is just for aesthetics. Once you open the lid, the wheel locks in place. I wish there was a way to rotate it once the lid is open. It also did not come with any brush ... | 4.0
2 Pack Hair Towel Wrap Turban Microfiber Drying Shower and Bath, Twist Head Towels with Button, Magic Quick Dryer, Hair Care for Women and Girls, One Wrap Plus One Cap and Two Velvet Hair Bands | Got this for my daughter. She has medium-long hair and makes turbans out of regular towels all the time, so I thought that she would enjoy this. The hair wraps are cute and soft to the touch, so they feel comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, some of the strings were loose, so not a very high quality sewing. Because the product is made with soft microfiber material, it does not work as well as a regular towel to dry the hair. The cap is even less effective than the turban, because the hair stays loose inside and the moisture does not absorb. My daughter complained that she wore the wrap for a while and when she took it off, her hair was still very wet. She told me ... | 3.0

Willie Morrow's Unbreakable Thermo Blow Dry Nozzle | None of the attachments would work on the couple of blow dryers I tried. I finally got it to work by having it halfway open at the attachment end as it splits into 2 and had it only held on by the metal attachment. It worked fine but would get really hot and needed constant tightening and adjustment. Much easier to just use a comb while blow drying. | 3.0
Beard Shampoo & Beard Wash - Man-Sized 8.45 OZ Bottle - Nourishing All Natural Oils - Cleans, Softens & Conditions - Premium Beard Soap | The beard wash has a Vick's Vapor Rub type smell same as with their beard oil. The smell doesn't last long and usually disappears by the time you're done washing it out. I've used this beard wash along with regular shampoo/conditioner and while this is gentler on facial hair than regular shampoo, I haven't noticed this being any better. However it is cheap and as you should only be washing your beard a few times a week it will last you a long time. | 3.0

MelodySusie Large Acrylic Makeup Organizer - A Set of 3 Pieces Transparent Modern Jewelry and Cosmetic Storage/The Best Makeup Holder for All of Your Cosmetics, Jewelries, Nail Polishes etc. | Plastic and/or acrylic organizers come in all sizes, shapes, configurations and qualities. MelodySusie® has blown me away with this three part, multiple sectioned organizer with drawers. Just so you're clear, you get a base with four drawers, each with an flattened oval shaped pull, each lined with a black textile that can be removed or used as you choose. The edges of the drawers are beveled, giving this an aura of elegance, but most importantly, each drawer slides in and out with ease, regardless of whether or not the drawer is packed or empty. The bottom of the base has a little strip in the form which raises this organizer from sitting directly on the counter, so if it is used in a bathroom, air can circulate ... | 5.0
