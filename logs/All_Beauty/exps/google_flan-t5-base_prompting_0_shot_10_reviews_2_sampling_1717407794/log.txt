10ML Essential Oil 100% Pure Natural Undiluted Therapeutic Grade Perfect for Aromatherapy, Relaxation, Skin Therapy Cleaning (Cajeput) | Cajeput Essential Oil (EO) is great in blends for men. My men's milk shaving soap is one of my best sellers at the farmers market.<br /><br />I've been using EO's for well over a decade. I use them in my own skin care products such as lip balms & creams plus my own milk soaps, bathroom sprays, fungal salves, & even blends for treating my farm animals. I never use toxic fragrance oils or perfumes. When I switched to an organic natural lifestyle, my health improved dramatically. I highly recommend essential oils over the toxic man made crapola.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased. | 5.0
10Pack 2oz Plastic Empty Spray Bottle, Mostof Fine Mist Small Clear Travel Plastic Bottles Container with Funnels Labels | These perform very well. I use them to make my own essential oil (EO) bug sprays, after sun sprays, room refreshers, etc. They are small, spray well & don't leak.<br /><br />The small size is great for portability. I take one of my bug spray formulas outside with me for while I work on my farm. Because I only use EO's the effectiveness wears off much faster than synthetic products. I keep the bottle on me to respray as needed. I have a bottle in my purse with a germ fighting blend for when stores are out of the cart wipes. I even made up a bottle of toilet spray. I use peppermint EO for that.<br /><br />The funnel has a very narrow spout making pouring a ... | 5.0
CESTLV Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush + Toothpaste Kit (10 Pack Bulk), Hotel Amenities for Guest & Travel, BPA Free, Individually Boxed Dental Kits, Recyclable | I ordered these for when I have guests on my eco farm. I'm not a fan of plastic toothbrushes & have been using bamboo toothbrushes for many years now. It is interesting to see folks reaction to these types of toothbrushes. I know I've managed to convert some over to bamboo, but not everyone. The mini toothpaste is nice & minty, providing a good, refreshing cleaning.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased. | 5.0
Lesentia Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 31 – Tinted Moisturizer For Face With Spf and Blemish Concealer with All Natural Ingredients like Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and Zinc* (Medium - 2fl oz) | This is a really nice tinted moisturizer. I run my own eco farm full time & need a lot of sun protection. I always wear a wide brimmed Sloggers brand hat along with a natural tinted moisturizer with SPF.<br /><br />Lesentia with a SPF of 31, provides natural looking coverage & helps to keep my skin tone more even looking. It adds a nice warm touch of color that is perfect for summer wear. It performs exactly as described. It does leave a shine, so I touch it up with Organic Wear pressed powder. There are no weird ingredients or fragrances.<br /><br />Another natural tinted moisturizer I like is by Organic Wear. Organic Wear provides a very thin, light coverage that requires a little bit of pressed ... | 5.0
Feather Headbands Hippie Dreamcatcher Head Chains Boho Tribal Feather Headpiece Peacock Feather Hair Band Hair Accessories (E) | I run my own eco farm full time. I ordered this because I thought it would work really great in some photo props & it does. The "leather" sections are synthetic but still look good. The beads are wooden. There are two dyed green pheasant feathers & some really excellent quality rooster saddle feathers. The two silver beads that you use to adjust the size of the headpiece are plastic. The dream catcher section feels like cotton, it is a pretty blue color that compliments the peacock feather perfectly.<br /><br />It's very earthy & very natural, just what this dirt loving tree hugger farm girl loves.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased. | 5.0
Girzzur fashion headbands for women-(6 Pack) yoga running headbands for women nonslip of wide boho Face washing makeup cloth hair bands | I ordered these because the similar hair bands I bought from Walmart were pretty well worn. These appeared to function pretty much the same way, so I went ahead & ordered them. While I do like them & they will work for my purposes, they are not as wide as they appear in the product photos (my Walmart ones are double the width). I took off a star for that & only that. Otherwise they are great. I love the variety of prints, they are comfortable, & look good.<br />If it helps, I have long straight hair that goes past my bra line. I don't have bangs. I work outdoors everyday for my full time job which is running my eco family farm. Keeping my hair out ... | 4.0
Eye Mask Natural Mulberry 100% Silk Super Smooth Sleep Eye Mask for Eye Mask for Puffy Eyes for Dry Eyes for Dark Circles Sleeping Travel While Camping Multi Purpose Men and Women Eye Mask | This sleep mask is wonderful. It's thin, soft & made of real silk. The elastic band is comfortable & adjustable. I've gone through so many sleep masks since my fav from the natural food store (made of silk, cotton & filled with lavender, but thin, not puffy) finally gave up the ghost. If this had lavender buds in in... OMG, it would be perfection. Anyway, this is the closest I've found to that old mask & I absolutely love it. | 5.0
Juice Organics Lip Amplifier - 0.5 oz. | I am really big on Organic & safe products. I was very excited about this lip amplifier having given up on them when I discovered how toxic they were. Sadly this product turned out to be a big disappointment & I will not purchase again.<br /><br />The only thing to like about this product is it's good safety rating in the EWG Cosmetics Database & it provides a nice shine. That's where it ends.<br /><br />It smells unpleasant. It is very very watery & thin. It says to apply generously. If you try to do that it will be all over your face. It does not last long & it is not moisturizing. It does not plump the lips(I have yet to find a product that does) ... | 2.0

Royal Locks Curl Rescue Leave in Conditioner | Curly Hair Therapy | Keravis Ultra Conditioning Formula | 4 Oz | From my daughter: I like that you can use this product in a variety of ways, when hair is wet as a leave in conditioner, when hair is dry to protect it from heat styling or after it is styled to add shine. I put some on my hair after I straightened it and it seemed to work well to tame frizz and add shine. It has a light scent that isn't overpowering. | 4.0
Hair Straightener, Flat Iron for Hair Styling, 2 in 1 Hair Curling and Straightening Tool, Non-Damage Floating Ceramic Plates, Adjustable Temperature 300°F-450°F for All Hair Types and Lengths | This flat iron works well to straighten hair, but I couldn't get it to curl very well like other straighteners I have. It is easy to use and the red light on the dial turns green when it is ready which is nice. | 4.0
Manicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and"Catcher" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack) | Clippers work well. I prefer to use them without the plastic catcher that is attached, but it easily comes off. Nice travel case that includes a nail file. Clippers are very sharp and cut efficiently and smoothly. | 4.0

Emilia Hypoallergenic Bath Oil for Babies - Paraben-Free Natural Baby Wash Enriched With Natural Oat Extract, Sunflower, Sweet Almond, Sesame, Calendula, and Chamomile 8.5 fl.oz. | Makes my sons skin moisturized which will be great during the winter months. It helps me too when I use it | 5.0

Cuckoo Eyelashes 100% handmade 3D Faux Mink Lashes 4 Pairs/set … (Cuckoo 309) | (307) These lases are a little more dense so they definitely give the look of wearing false lashes, in kind of a more dated kind of way. I feel like the more spread out and whispy lashes are a lot more trendy these days. Band is quite thick also. Besides the band, the lashes themselves are pretty good quality and don't have a plastic sheen to them which is great. Price and quality is comparable to drugstore.<br /><br />(309) Also have a thicker band but are much more Whispy and have that fluffy instagram lash to them. Very pretty! I like these a lot better than the 307's. I'd give these a 5 and a 307 a 3 so since they're the same brand, I will average ... | 4.0
Bioré J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce | Was interested in what this was going to feel like but I guess "jelly" really is the closest consistency to describe this.<br /><br />It more viscous than water and has a bit of "bounce" to it but doesn't feel oily or greasy. I apply it straight on my face, rub it in a bit, then add a bit of water to my hands, lather, then rub again. Then rinse k<br /><br />I have combo skin with drier cheeks and this doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. Still feels moisturized.<br /><br />This product smells of roses pretty strongly but I actually love the way it smells so I don't mind at all.<br /><br />Wouldn't really recommend for eye makeup though, I did find it to sting ... | 5.0
[moonshot] Cream Paint Lightfit Air 3g - Blackpink Lisa Makeup Kpop Kbeauty Cosmetics, Airy Velvet Texture Matte Lip Makeup, Long Lasting Natrual Daily Lip Color (501 Almond Rose) | A pretty MLBB velvety lip color. The formula isn't nearly as drying as typical matte liquid lips. More of a velvety mousse like texture.<br /><br />I have medium tan skin and I'd say this is a nude pink shade on me so it may be a bit light for deeper skin tones.<br /><br />I discovered you can also use this as a cheek color as well! I dab a bit on the back of my hand and apply it from there. It's pretty pigmented on the cheeks so starting with less is better. | 5.0
JPNK 10PCS Makeup tool set, Blender Sponges& Air cushion puff&Sponge Holder for Blending Liquid, Cream or Flawless Powder Cosmetics | You never know what you're gonna get with some of these beauty sponges, but this is definitely one of the good sets.<br /><br />The sponges are actually soft and don't absorb as much product as other sponges. I recently tried another brand that looked exactly the same but they were so hard and rubbery. These are soooo much softer in comparison. I don't feel like I'm softly punching my face like I do with the others😂<br /><br />Very easy to clean, after use and have no weird smell or anything. I haven't used the puffs or brush yet but I'm going to attempt to use the puffs for powder or maybe even jelly products. The brush would probably work well for concealer or eyeshadow primer. It has ... | 5.0

Electronic Breath Spray for Bad Breath, Dry Mouth Spray, Heavy Super Mint Flavor Rechargeable Oral Care Mist, Oral Care Mouth Freshener | Impressive effectiveness from a simple vapor stream. Provides a strong mint blast and sweet mint flavor. Helps ice down a scratchy throat too. A bit pricey but a pretty neat device. Refills are pricey too. | 4.0
Organic Patchouli Beard Wash by American Shaving Co, Rich, Foaming Cleanser that Softens, cleanse & Strengthens the beard hair, Clean and Refresh your beard with Patchouli Fragrance - 8 oz | Not bad...Large size, pumps a thick tan cream. Fair amount of sud/foam. Pretty strong, classic, patchouli scent. Scent washes out a bit with the soap but leaves a nice, light amount behind. Does a good job at cleansing and softening. | 4.0
10 Magnets Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner, LANKIZ Exclusive 3x Stronger 1mm Ultra-Light Magnets, 5D Magnetic Lashes Pack Natural Look with 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliner Kit & Unique Applicator Tool | My wife is pretty happy with these. Nice aesthetics, decent magnets...Trick is to find the right amount of liner, it requires a good amount for a strong cling but not a crazy amount. | 4.0
Somaluxe Collagen Moisturizer with 3 Types of Collagen Peptides and Hyaluronic Acid, 2 oz | The cream is fairly thin, with a pudding like consistency. Applies and spreads well. Leave a hydrated feel without an oily or shiny residual. Happy with it's performance, just not crazy about the scent. Smells earthy, like peat moss. | 4.0
Dog Paw Washer Automatic Cleaner for Small and Medium dogs with Brush Pet Foot Cup Silicone | [[VIDEOID:5d66b612355cbdece6627644534d9174]] The biggest downside to this cleaner is it's price. Price is subjective, but you don't feel like you are getting a $50 product. The logo is just a crappy sticker, it feels pretty thin, isn't very powerful and didn't come with a wall plug (only cord, not a huge deal but for the price...). There are similar ones for less.<br /><br />Performance wish, I like it a lot. Coming from a manual one, this makes for much easier work to wrangle my dog an let this do the work. It is not very powerful but that is okay as it doesn't scare my dogs. This is a 4 star product but I feel I had to remove another star for it's price/value. | 3.0
Automatic Hand Soap/Sanitizer Dispenser Kit - Table liquid Dispenser Pump Station 13.5 oz. Alcohol-Based Sprayer | **update** Unit stopped working after a few days. New (and tested) batteries placed in it and it won't power on. The second part, which is my original review stands true...However, I can not longer give a good rating to a product that lasted a couple days. Your results may vary.<br /><br />Nice little dispenser. Good goldielocks size, not too big, not too small. Doesn't get in the way but doesn't get overlooked. Sanitary design and functions well. | 2.0
3 Barrel Curling Iron, 25mm Curling Waver Iron Hair Waver with LCD Display Adjustable Temperature 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Triple Hair Crimper Hair Tools for Deep Waves All Style (1#) | Really nice iron! 5 stars based off of it's value at a $35 price point. Is it a top of the line, 5 star iron? No...But for this price, it is an excellent value for an entry level device. The handle is very ergonomic with an on/off button with +/- temperature control. It heats up quick enough, giving you a temp readout on the LCD display. The iron itself is a little thin and somewhat cheaply painted but it functions nicely. The clasp opens and closes with ease but has good retention. My wife was unsure if she'd like one of these and she is very happy with it and it's results! | 5.0
NAILGIL Poly Nail Gel (Temperature) | Nice set for the money. Packaged nicely to make for a great gift. Colors are on point and so far they are holding up will on my wife, who is a nurse and bangs her hands around all day. | 5.0
SUPRENT Razors for Men with Matrix Cutter Head, 38.5° Golden Angle Shaving Kit for Men, Travelling Razor Kit-1 Mens Razor Handle, 2 Blade Refills,1 Dock,1 Shave Foam | This is a tough one to review...Works great on my neck and face but not so great on my bald head. The ergonomics are fantastic, it's a hefty metal body with nice curves. The blade nestles in the top groove with metal surrounding it...This makes for a difficult close shave from my bald head curves, I like to press down harder and get a close shave but the surrounding metal prevents that from happening. However, on my neck and cheeks, it does well, particularly with a dry shave.<br /><br />The foam is nice but nothing special. Doesn't slick up great but has a nice scent. The holder is okay...Sturdy but holds the blade loosely. Also, as of now, I don't see where I can get replacement blades. | 3.0
AZURE Hyaluronic & Retinol Anti Aging Under Eye Pads- Moisturizing & Rejuvenating Eye Mask Patches - Reduces Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Dark Circles & Puffiness - Skin Care Made in Korea - 5 Pairs | Pretty straight forward. Come 2 to a sealed pouch. They are stacked in the pouch so they can be a little difficult to get apart and straightened out. No noticeable or standout scent to them. Apply smooth, nice that they have slits so you can shape it to your contour. They do a nice job refreshing and smoothing my eyes. | 4.0

[the SAEM] Derma Plan Cleansing Bubble Pad 15pcs - One Step Gentle Makeup Cleansing Wipes Produce Fine & Dense Bubbles, Hypoallergenic Formula, Pore Clean, Mild Exfoliation | I was so happy when I saw these little cleansing pads on Amazon! I was a HUGE fan of the just-add-water cleaning pads that used to be on the market several years ago (not sure if it was Ponds or Oil of Olay that made them), but then those stopped being sold. They were the best for traveling since they were dry until you planned to use them. Like these pads from the SAEM, you never had to worry about leakage in your bag, TSA pulling them, or the pads drying out. Just like those old cleansing pads, these also have a smooth side for cleansing and a textured side for exfoliating. Unlike those other pads, these have a nifty little pocket to slide over your fingers.<br ... | 5.0
Folora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Blue-2 | This is a nice assortment of headbands for adding some pizzaz to your hair, but they are kind of frustrating when it comes to keeping your hair held back because the inside of the band is soft rather than having the little 'teeth' that help hold your hair in place. Unless you use bobby pins underneath to hold your hair back and use these headbands to cover up the pins, you will be constantly pulling this band off and sliding it back in place to rescuer your hair due to hair coming loose. Not having the teeth makes these comfortable to wear, which makes these good for little ones who aren't fans of any pokey edges on their hair accessories. The bands are pretty thin, just fabric ... | 4.0
10Pcs Foldable Duo Angled Eyebrow Brush and Spoolie Brush Mascara Applicator Eyelash Separator Eyebrow Grooming Brush Tool | These turned out to be really well made little eyelash/eyebrow spoolies! The brush side has soft bristles that are cut evenly and are securely attached to the base so there's been no bristle fallout anytime I use them. The spoolie side has a thick brush that works great to catch clumps and separate lashes. Both ends are easy to use, easy to clean, and the tool folds up for easy storage. One thing I didn't overly like about this tool is how super lightweight it is - like 'light as a feather' light. Part of that is due to it only being just over four inches long, but from looking at the picture on the listing I expected these to weigh a bit more. Another dislike is ... | 4.0
SALOCY Facial Mask Applicator,Facial Mask Brush 4 Piese with 2 Piese Cat ear Headbands | Love the headbands, the brushes are pretty good. I took a pair of pliers and crimped down the metal onto the bristles so it held them better as I don't know how long the glue holding the bristles in will last after repeated washings. The handles are smooth and splinter free. The brush bristles are soft and won't scratch your skin, and smoothly applies masks from clay to gel. The bristles wash clean easily and haven't stained or changed color. The headbands are soft, totally adorable, and stay put. They wash well, but I've never put mine in the dryer and instead hang them up to air dry. | 4.0

Mirror Flower Nail Clippers Set 2Pcs, No Splash Nail Clippers for Fingernail and Toenail, Medical Grade Stainless Steel, Sharp Stainless Steel Flat/Oblique Nail Clipper, Trimmer Set for Men and Women | We needed to replace our worn out nail clippers and these have been a good choice. Made of stainless steel they're lightweight yet strong and open and close smoothly. The blades are sharp enough for even clean cuts and the angled pair are perfect for pesky hang nails. The nail clipping slots are something I've never encountered before but its a rather ingenious idea!<br /><br />Thanks for reading this review and I hope its helpful | 5.0
FOAMIST Thickening Caffeine 3 Peptides Complex Hair Conditioner for hair loss, thin hair 250ml / 8.4 fl.oz. | I'm on the fence regarding the merits of this conditioner. I have aging [I'm 74] thin baby fine color treated hair with only normal seasonal hair loss. On the first try, I washed my hair using my normal shampoo and applied the conditioner following the directions, leaving it on 3 mins then rinsing it out. After one use, I'm not overly impressed with its ability to add thickness to my strands but it did leave my hair soft and didn't weigh it down.<br /><br />Its a thick cream with a pleasant odor and on short hair [pixie] a little goes a long way. I plan on using it over the next few weeks hoping eventually it will thicken and volumize my thin hair and encourage growth. If ... | 4.0
4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Natural Waterproof Mascara Extra Long Lash,Thick Thickening and Lengthening, No Clumping, No Smudging, Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Mascara | First off I wear contact lens and so far I've had no adverse reaction. I've only tried it once and it stayed put for 24 hrs, even though a shower! Now that's what I call really waterproof! I don't normally sleep in makeup of any kind but wanted to give it an "all night" durability test. Woke up the next morning....was still there! Expected at least some "mascara" marks on my pillowcase but there was nary a mark. But my biggest surprise came when I awoke without "racoon eyes"!!! I usually wear "tubing" mascaras as other formulas end up under my eyes within a few hours, I actually expected this mascara to do the same.<br /><br />Volume and length? It definitely added length. I use Latisse so ... | 5.0
R-NEU 200 Cotton Rounds, 100% Natural Turkish Cotton Makeup Remover and Facial Cleansing Cotton Round Pads, Waffle Textured Hypoallergenic Cotton Wipes, 2.25 Inch Diameter (200 Pack) | Swisspers is my usual brand but for some strange reason I decided to give these a try. They're "ok" ...they are soft and absorbent but they tend to shed fibers even when wet. As I use these around my eye area that is not a good thing! Will return to my usual rounds. | 3.0
FERYES Makeup Sponge Holder with Makeup Sponge– Eco-Friendly Silicone Beauty Make Up Blender Case and Dry & Wet Use Foundation Sponge for Travel - Khaki (MS Khaki) | Wish I'd thought of this! Whenever I travel I use to keep my sponge in a zip lock bag for obvious reasons. Although it never got moldy that was my fear, this holder is a god send to anyone who travels. But of course its also great for at home storage. Super soft and easy to pop your sponge in and out. Great idea and wonderful gift, recommend | 5.0
By Terry Hyaluronic Pressed Hydra-Powder | Transcluscent | Infused with Hyaluronic Acid | Vegan | OMG am I glad I tried this powder. I'm 70 and my once oily skin is now normal so the addition of HA prompted me to give it a try. Its so finely milled that it goes on light as air and disappears into your foundation. I only use a tiny amount of powder on my T-zone, but with slightly oily eyelids, shadow tends to crease even with primer so I tried it on my lids. After my eye cream and primer, I dusted it lightly over my crease area and applied shadow. My shadow stayed put with O creasing! And, unlike other powders I've tried on my lids, this one didn't enhance my slightly crinkly lids! This one is worth the $$. | 5.0
EASYDEW Fill Up Volume Spot 0.67 fl oz -Anti-Aging Filler Spot Good for Topical Wrinkle Care with Hyaluronic Acid I Moisturizer with Instant Filling Effect and Skin Renewal | For Topical Area | I just started using this filler and at this time I don't feel its had the appropriate time for me to see any change in the depth of my fine lines. So this will be a 1st impression review that I will revisit after I've used this for a few weeks.<br /><br />[From the box/packaging] This product is made by the Korean, Daewoong Pharmaceutical [DN Co.] Company which according to the company's website is a global healthcare company that strives to contribute to the beauty molding industry in Korea and around the world.<br /><br />The gel has an easy to use unique packaging that doses out just the right amount needed to pat over wrinkles and fine lines. The gel, when first applied, feels slightly sticky but ... | 4.0
TIANG Facial Steamer, Nano Ionic Mist Face Steamer, Hydrating Mist Sprayer Water Oxygen Injection, Nano Steamer Portable Mist Humidifier, for Face Mini Spa Rejuvenation, Moisturizing Refreshing | My first thought was that this was another gimmick but being a skincare junkie had to try it. I'm so glad that I did as it exceeded my expectations to the point that I've overlooked a few things I'd normally dock it on.<br /><br />First use: My usual routine is to wash my makeup off and immediately apply HA [Hyaluronic acid] to relieve the resulting dry tight feeling. I filled this sprayer with HA serum and at first, didn't feel anything but cool air hitting my face and wondered if any serum was even coming out. Then suddenly the tightness was gone and my face felt like it was covered with a moisture mask. When applying HA with my fingers it always took a minute or two ... | 5.0
8 Rolls White Eyelash Extension PE Tape, Adhesive Fabric Eyelash Tape, Lash PE Tape for Eyelash Extension Supply, 1/2'' x 10 Yards | Although this tape is designed for eyelash extensions, I wanted to see how it worked when applying eye-shadow. I use the makeup artist's Scotch tape trick for applying eye shadow [see Dominique Sachse's, Caught on Tape U tube video] and love the effect. However, Scotch tape doesn't stick to skin evenly/smoothly leaving gaps and when its peeled off it takes some foundation with it. I was hoping this would work better and I've not been disappointed. It's easy to apply and goes on smoothly with no wrinkles or gaps and it removes without taking foundation with it. Leaving you with a nice winged effect to your shadow. Now that I think about it, it should also work for winged eyeliner. | 5.0
Garnier Whole Blends Softening Shampoo Bar for Fine to Normal Hair, Oat Delicacy, 2 Oz, 1 Count (Packaging May Vary) | My husband recently switched from liquid shampoos to bars and now prefers them. He made the switch after trying several liquid shampoos that not only didn't help his thinning dry hair they irritated his scalp.<br /><br />Garnier, being a well known brand, I wanted him to try this one and right now its his #2 choice from the 4 he's tried. It hasn't irritated his scalp and he's so far happy with how his thinning, fine hair looks and feels.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and I hope this review is helpful | 4.0

100 pcs Compressed Facial Mask Women DIY Beauty Facial Cotton Paper Compress Masque Disposable Dry Sheet Mask for Skin Face Care | I wasn't sure what to expect from these compressed facial masks in terms of quality, as reviews were across the board. But, they far exceeded my needs and expectations!<br />They are about the size of three dimes stacked, and are embossed with little flowers on top, which is really just a pretty presentation.<br />They expand easily with moisture, I mixed up my own serum solution with essential oil, and it was easy to soak and unfold. I worried I would have to be super delicate so as not to tear the paper, but these are more of a fabric than tissue.<br />In fact, I opened one up to test it's durability. I used some warm water, added some dish soap and went to town scrubbing my basin. ... | 5.0
TOUCH IN SOL Flawless Skin Top Coat 1.18 fl.oz. (35ml) - One Step Makeup (Nourishing Ampoule + High Adhesive Makeup Base + Fresh Silky Powder), Moisturizing High Coverage Foundation (#1 Light) | My friend recommended this Touch in Sol Flawless skin top coat, and I am so glad she did.<br />It is really more of a foundation, it has perfect medium coverage. It feels amazing on my skin, light and silky smooth. It leaves me looking matte, but not dry. It's surprisingly radiant.<br />I use it over the Touch in Sol primer, without setting powder, and it easily lasts the whole day.<br />So, here I am recommending it to you! Try it! It's amazing! | 5.0
The Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine | This is actually a decent palette of eyeshadows. They are not super pigmented, but very easy to work with. This is a very nice beginner palette, especially for the under 10 price.<br />That said, these need a primer. They last an okay amount of time, but will fade quickly if you don’t use a primer.<br />Simple cardboard container, very similar to colourpop and bh, but doesn’t have a mirror. Still it’s sturdy and all the pans arrived unbroken!<br />The shades are arranged nicely, it really has a visual appeal, and makes choosing an eye look easier.<br />It’s realky not bad, and while my tastes typically run towards the more luxury and pigmented, this is a good entry for a beginner or lighter makeup user.<br />I will be ... | 3.0
AG Care Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar Leave On Mist | This leave in hair remedy from AG smells wonderful, like a sweet and spicy scent. While it applies strong, it dissipated and left behind a soft clean spicy smell.<br />It worked really well, and was best when I used it after a work out on damp hair vs dry or showered.<br />It’s a nice product in my easy care hair Arsenal, I will be picking it up again for my gym bag for sure! | 4.0

Cleansing Bentonite Clay Powder - 1 Lb - Deep Skin Pore and Body Cleanser, All Natural, Detoxifying, Use for DIY facial masks, shampoo, creams, lotions, deodorant etc. by Aspen Naturals | On receipt of this Aspen Naturals Bentonite Clay Amazing Skin and Body Detoxifier, there was a tamper-proof seal in place over the opening of the jar for peace of mind in knowing it arrived to me pure and untampered with. The Bentonite Clay is a fine powder is easy to use with easy-to-follow directions right on the back of the label, although there are many other uses as well. I appreciate that this came well-protected for a safe delivery, which is a big part of a product, to be able to order it and know it will arrive safe and sound.<br /><br />I have used this several times as a face mask mixed with Rose Hydrosol and a drop of Frankincense Essential Oil, which worked perfectly for ... | 5.0
BEST FACE MASK WITH PINK ROSE CLAY - SPRING SALE - Organic Ingredients - Includes Ebook - Smooths Skin and Reduces Pores, Improves Aging Spots, Redness, Blemishes - Reduces Fine Lines | This Maywood Creek Essentials Rose Clay Mud Mask comes in a nice lightweight plastic jar with a shiny silver lid. The product label contains all the pertinent information, such as directions, ingredients (a lovely blend of natural skin-nurturing ingredients), company information, expiration date, which is about a year out, giving me plenty of time to finish this Rose Clay Mud Mask. Interestingly, the label says to “shake well before every use,” but my mask is a soft solid. This mask has a different texture than I have seen before in a mask, perhaps due to the glycerin. I would say the scent is somewhat of a mix of light roses and (more so) citrus/grapefruit, best I can tell, which would be from the grapefruit and yuzi essential ... | 5.0
Micellar Cleansing Water - Gentle Alcohol Free, No Rinse Facial Cleanser and Makeup Remover - For All Skin Types including Sensitive - Great for Travel, Post-Workout and Before Bedtime | This Pure Bliss Micellar Cleansing Water arrived in a plastic bag to assure that, if it did leak, it did not leak on other products, but it did not leak. It is a generous eight ounces, comes in a clear plastic bottle so you can tell when the product is getting low, and it comes with a handy flip-top lid that can be manipulated with one hand for ease of use. The scent of this is very light, if there is any at all. The label is tidy and contains the pertinent information, such as ingredients, Made in the USA, product information, and directions.

After coming across this conditioner, it sounded perfect for my hair, so I decided to give it a try. The bottle itself is streamline and attractive, containing all of the pertinent information such as ingredients, directions, cautions, company information, and Made in the USA. I like that it is also paraben-free, sulfate-free, cruelty-free, organic, and vegan. The easy flip-top lid is very helpful in dispensing the conditioner and I am always happy when a product comes with a tamper-proof seal in place, as this did.<br /><br />This conditioner is beautifully creamy, thick, and rich and smells wonderfully fresh and citrusy, uplifting and delicious, and is ... | 5.0

JPNK 10PCS Makeup tool set, Blender Sponges& Air cushion puff&Sponge Holder for Blending Liquid, Cream or Flawless Powder Cosmetics | You never know what you're gonna get with some of these beauty sponges, but this is definitely one of the good sets.<br /><br />The sponges are actually soft and don't absorb as much product as other sponges. I recently tried another brand that looked exactly the same but they were so hard and rubbery. These are soooo much softer in comparison. I don't feel like I'm softly punching my face like I do with the others😂<br /><br />Very easy to clean, after use and have no weird smell or anything. I haven't used the puffs or brush yet but I'm going to attempt to use the puffs for powder or maybe even jelly products. The brush would probably work well for concealer or eyeshadow primer.

Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | This is a nice set of six nail polishes, all in identical black bottles. I assume this is because the polishes are light sensitive and so the black bottles protect all of them from degrading due to harsh lighting. As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would ... | 4.0
Gents of London Design Paste Matt Firm Hold Professional Hair Styling Wax (3 oz) | I think it works better as a styling wax - it didn't stiffen my hair as much as I would have liked, but the cream made it a breeze to style. The scent is a little strong but it's pleasant. I think this product could be used by both men and women though it's obviously intended for men. This product is made in England and the graphics are pleasant to look at it - it has a quaint Victorian vibe about it. Overall I'm pleased with the product but the price could be better | 4.0
Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum with Natural Mango Micro-beads, Vitamins E and C, Natural and Organic Plant Extracts, Paraben-Free, 30 ml, Made in France, Phytema | I love the scent of this anti-aging serum but I didn't notice any significant effects on the wrinkle beneath my right eye. In addition, the microbeads don't dissolve easily and I had to rub the serum several times before they were absorbed by my face. I also recently learned microbeads are also bad for the environment because they can poison fish if they're disposed of in drains and end up in the ocean. So I won't be ordering any more products with this ingredient. | 2.0
10 Pcs Brown and 10 Pcs Black Wig Grip Headband for women | This headband is soft and flexible. It keeps my hair from falling into my eyes when I do my morning routine of washing my face. It's also great for holding your hair back after you shampoo and making it easier to style. It can also be washed after every use and dries quickly because the material isn't too thick. Overall it's of a good quality. | 5.0
Bouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz | I have a weakness for beautifully decorated soap bottles. This Bouquet Garni bottle looks great and I'm tempted to use this as a hand soap rather than as a body wash just so I can display it on my sink. As for the scent, "White Musk" I don't like it as much. It's OK, but I prefer lavender but thought I'd give it a try. As a wash, it foams up nicely and leaves my skin feeling soft and cleansed. It's made in Korea, home to many high qualty skin care companies so I trust its quality (more so than if it's from China!).<br /><br />Again, I love the bottle so I'll be sure to re-use it after the body wash is all gone, but if I ... | 4.0
Kneipp Shower Foam Goodbye Stress Water Mint & Rosemary 6.81 Oz | The only thing I didn't like about this shower "foam" is how quickly it will be used up. It comes in a relatively small caninster and it comes out like shaving foam, only it's for the body and not for the face. It feels great and helps clear my stuffed sinuses. The scent is "mint and rosemary" but I feel like it's mostly mint. It's a step up above your ordinary shower gel but it won't likely last as long, as it's hard to tell how much of the bottle you are actually using since it's not liquid. Except for that caveat, I liked this. | 4.0
CLAIR BEAUTY Hyaluronic & Retinol Day Cream & Facial Serum Collection Gift Set - Hydrating, Rejuvenating & Anti Aging | Reduces Wrinkles & Fine Lines | Locks in Moisture, Smoothing & Evening Skin Tone | Considering it's low price point, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this set performed on my skin. I have dry patches on my cheeks and the moisturizer worked really well at keeping my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I didn't like the eye serum as much (I didn't see much of a difference) but it didn't irritate my skin so both products are decent for the price. | 4.0
Beast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast | This is a strongly scented mens body wash with notes of ginseng, green tea, menthol and Vitamin B. Caffeine is also listed as an ingredient. The menthol and the ginseng scents overpower the rest. It lathers up very well and imparts a cooling sensation that makes you tingle all over and even clears your sinuses! I would recommend this body wash for people with colds because this really helps. I love it. | 5.0
Biutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED | I already have a number of gel nail polishes but I love the iridescent glitter of these nail polishes. They are very sparkly and the gel lasts a long time. It's a small set so it will be used up fairly quickly. The only thing I didn't like about it was the strong chemical odor of the polish but it dissipates after awhile. Except for this, I love the look of this nail polish. | 5.0
UV LED Nail Lamp – 128W Rapid-Curing Gel Nails Dryer for Manicures and Pedicures – Dual-Voltage with Extra-Long Cable, Multi-Language Manual – Professional Gel Lamp for Homes or Salons by OVLUX, Gold | I've reviewed many nail lamps and I like this one because of the color, the ease of operation and how quickly it dries my nails. It has a wide mouth so you can put both hands in if your hands are small and the same goes with your feet.<br />The LED screen is bright and easy to read. It has a strong UV light but you can adjust the speed so you can use just enough to dry your nails (too much may be bad for your hands). Overall it's a decent nail lamp but the price feels a little high for this type of item. | 4.0

Reusable Shower Cap for Women – Leakproof, Nonslip Hair Cap for Shower w/ Comfy Flexiband – Soft, Breathable Shower Caps for Women Reusable Waterproof – Durable, Heavy Duty Shower Cap by SMPL OBJECTS (Marble) | This is a quality shower cap I have been looking for. I have long, thick hair and sometimes after straightening my hair I just want to wash my body, I would have to tie or clip my hair up. But unfortunately, water still ends up wetting my hiar. The shower cap material is good quality. It is thick and waterproof. The cute, floral design is a plus and there is a cute bow in the front.

The instructions that came with the stands are unfortunately in Chinese without translation so assembling was quite confusing at first. | 4.0
Travel Bottles for Toiletries, Silicone Travel Size Bottles And Squeezable Containers Holders with belt clip Keychain for Backpack, Shampoo, Liquid, Cosmetic Products(2 oz, 6 Pack) | I am using these for hand sanitizers. The order comes with 3 white, 1 pink, light blue, and blue. They are silicone tubes with white plastic caps. It comes with black key chain holder so it’s portable. Each tube holds 60 ML. I put high alcohol content hand sanitizer so it’s more liquid than gel. Unfortunately I have to be extra careful for the liquid to not spill out when using. Otherwise the tubes should be able to contain the get and you’d just squeeze the tube. The bottle itself is spill proof. The cap is sealed tight. It is easy to refill through the wide mouth opening to fill up with any content. | 4.0
Gel Nail Polish Set, Holiday Red Black 6 Colors Gel Polish Kit Popular Nail Art Design Soak Off LED Lamp Nail Polish Gel Manicure Kit Gifts Set for Girls Women Professional DIY Home Use | The order comes with six different colored gel nail polish. The strange thing is, there are no colors labeled on the bottle. There’s a sticker for you to apply the gel and cure on sheet of white circle stickers to put on the bottle yourself. I found this strange and did not like it at all. The color swatches that I applied the gel polish to had the colors coming off of the sticker so I have to open the bottles to check the colors..<br /><br />There set comes with six different colors -<br />15 - black<br />16 - white<br />17 - dark purple<br />18 - dark brown/grey<br />19 - light beige<br />20 - red<br /><br />I like the basic colors. The gel quality I would say ... | 4.0

Here are some examples of user reviews and ratings for other items, in the format item description | review | rating (from 1.0 to 5.0):
CESTLV Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush + Toothpaste Kit (10 Pack Bulk), Hotel Amenities for Guest & Travel, BPA Free, Individually Boxed Dental Kits, Recyclable | Very decent bamboo toothbrush. Generally the bristles are too soft for me. This one is medium-soft. So at least it feels like my mouth is clean after brushing. Lightweight, no guilt. Even the packaging is made from recycled material. Great to have multi pack! | 5.0
lilah b. - Bronzed Beauty Bronzer Duo - b. sunkissed - Multipurpose Bronzer Duo to Highlight + Contour and Blend | This is such a high end product. The weighted compact feels sleek and heavy in your hand. The slide/pivot opening is clever and works smooth. The color saturation is rich and deep and looks flawless on many skin tones. Not too much shimmer, so it actually looks like you've been sun kissed after application. Buildable color if you want a more intense look. You can use both colors together, which is what I do. I am medium complexion, blonde, 48 years old. This product doesn't increase pores size, nor does it settle into any wrinkles. In my opinion, deserving of more than 5 stars. | 5.0
I WOKE UP LIKE THIS Turn-over Rice Perfect Oil Foam Cleanser – A Hypoallergenic Cleansing oil, Foaming Face Wash with Rice Bran Extract. Makeup Removal, Deep Facial Cleansing for Sensitive Skin | I love oil based cleansers and don't use anything else. But they are not for everyone. My 20 year old daughter doesn't like this product, while I think it's one of the best I've used. The smell is subtle and I love the suppleness of my skin after cleaning! | 5.0
Lovrio 20" 20 Pcs 50g Glue Hair Extensions Piano Color Dirty Blonde mixed with Light Golden Blonde P18-22 Seamless in Human Hair Hair Extensions With Adhensive Tape | Of all the extensions I've ordered, this is my least favorite. The blonde has so much brass in it! It's almost red in color. (I put a few pictures with my review. The lighter blonde is the color that I expect when I order blonde.) There are also more dark black strands coursing thru these pieces than any other brand I've used. Maybe it's just this particular color? Comes with clips, which is nice. And hair is soft. | 3.0
Organic Labs - Eyelash & Eyebrow Growth Serum - Enhancer Treatment to Grow Natural, Lush, Lavish Eyelashes & Eyebrows - Best Rapid Brow & Lash Boost for Longer, Fuller Lashes and Thicker Brows | I only received 1 tube of eyelash serum. I apply it right at my lash line, as directed, on a clean face. Have not seen any notable difference. Does not sting or irritate my eyes. | 3.0
C.O. Bigelow No. 007 Dr Hiosous Quince Hand Lotion, 4 Ounces | This stuff is wonderful. It's been a game changer for my hands this winter. There is very little scent. Which suprised me because it's filled with so many natural extracts like apple, lemon, carrot, aloe, grapefruit. The directions suggest to put on before bed and slip cotton gloves on. I'm not planning on doing that because I'm not 80, but am still very impressed at how long my hands feel protected and moisturized. | 5.0
