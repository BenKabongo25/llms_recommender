CELLEANSER Vegan Clean Cream 100% Vegan Ingredients Hydrating Nourishing Anti-Aging Balancing Panthenol Silky Made in Korea 60ml 2.02 fl.oz. | I am careful about what I put on my skin but I started using this cleanser every morning and noticed drastic results in brake outs and the clarity of my skin. The bottle is smaller than expected, but I will definitely be buying this again.
Everyday Beauty Radiance Cleanser, Rejuvenating Antioxidant Gel Cleanser with Rose Hip Seed Oil, Vitamin A, C, and E for All Skin Types to Soothe and Nourish Dry Damaged Skin, 4fl oz. Pump Bottle | I use this product in combination with the hydrating mask, also from the Everyday Beauty brand. I like this one especially because it replenishes and refreshes my skin as advertised. I love the pump bottle and I use it in the shower to help combat dry skin.
9 Pcs Silicone Makeup Brush Cover, Reusable Dustproof Makeup Brush Protector Cap,Travel Makeup Brush Storage Holder, 2 Styles with 4 Sizes for Different Sizes Makeup Brush | I love these silicone brushholders. I’m a little bit of a Germafobe when it comes to combining all of my make up brushes into one bag, the silicone holders go over the top of your brush head to keep them protected. They’re great for traveling, it comes with three big silicone heads and six little silicone heads for smaller brushes like eyeshadow brushes. Going to be buying more.
Beauty Bakerie Lip Whip Liquid Metallic Lipstick, Long Lasting Lip Color, Smudge Proof Makeup, Berried, 3.5 mL | The packaging is pretty and it is very pigmented and smudge proof. It lasts long and is a very cute color.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
This brush actually has a combo of both boar bristles and nylon bristles and is awesome for detangling long hair without shredding. The cushion holding the bristles adds to the comfort in use and its big enough to get the job done quickly. I find it also cuts down on fly aways from static. Good brush, I like it!
I have very long straight hair and since it takes forever to get conditioner out of my hair, I don't often use it. This means that I have to usually be very selective with the brushes I use. While I wouldn't necessarily use this brush on my hair wet, I absolutely love it for any other time. I've never used a boar brush, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was very pleased to see the brush glide through my hair smoothly and get through tangles easily. Its probably the most comfortable brush I've ever used, both on the hair/scalp, and in the hand. I don't have too much trouble with static electricity with this brush and it makes my hair look very smooth while using ...
[[VIDEOID:5e23a1c1959c042edae9287c6cfb389d]] I haven't bought a hairbrush in YEARS! But it was time to buy a new one and i saw this one, at first i got it because i loveee the color but i got it today and right away i brush my hair and felt very good.
This brush is great for detangling hair. The two bristles system seems to make a difference. I also love the weight and feel of the brush.
This brush glides through my daughters hair and leaves it looking shiny and healthy
This hair brush is a really pretty pastel purple with the two kinds of bristles. I really like brushes that have nylon and boar bristles in it. I feel like it’s more effective at detangling my hair and not just pulling it all out. It’s a really nice brush if you have thick wavy hair that gets tangled up easily.

The item description is BAR;SOO - Natural boar bristle paddle cushion hair brush for Thick Curly Thin Long Short hair, Detangle all types of hair, Hair loss prevention, Naturally glossy Hair (Purple/violet). What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: This is such a cute brush. It’s made well and with quality, especially the bristle hairs. The bristles aren’t tough, hard or irritating to the scalp. It works great on my long thick hair and no Bristles have popped out yet!

C.O. Bigelow No. 007 Dr Hiosous Quince Hand Lotion, 4 Ounces | A good hand cream is essential. This one is excellent. It is thick and creamy. It's very moisturizing and is packed with skin-loving botanicals. It's fragrance-free in case you have allergies or just prefer the unscented option. This is a high-quality hand cream that's great to keep in your bag.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
SUR.MEDIC+ 5 Types Recharging Energy Facial Solution Mask Sheet, 10 Pack, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Collagen, Glutathione-One Day One Sheet | This mask set allows you to choose exactly what your skin needs on any given day. There are five types. There's one for hydration, firming, brightening, healthy aging, and pore detoxing. For best results, leave the masks on for at least 15 minutes. Use the excess serum on your neck. I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

Organic Vitamin C Serum For Face with Hyaluronic Acid - Luxurious Formula Made with Only Natural Organic Ingredients. For Acne, Wrinkles, Fine Lines, Age Spots, Sun Damage (1 oz) | If you're over 35, this serum is a must. It contains two powerful skin-saving ingredients. Vitamin C keeps skin bright and radiant. It protects skin from UV damage. It boosts collagen production and helps fade dark spots quickly. Hyaluronic acid helps your skin draw moisture from the environment. It reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It's hard to find a high quality organic serum like this. I highly recommend this serum and the brand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
Brittanie's Thyme Hyaluronic Acid Serum, 8 oz, 100% Botanical Professional Clinical Strength for Face | Anti-Aging Anti Wrinkles & Hydrating Skincare Treatment | Hyaluronic acid is really one of the best skincare ingredients to use for hydrated skin. It keeps skin looking dewy and plump. You can add it to your moisturizer or apply it directly. Add a few drops to a mud/clay mask to make it a balancing treatment.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
[Abib] Creme coating mask Tone-up solution 17g (5pcs) | I use lots of sheet masks. Most leave your skin a little sticky when the serum dries. This mask works differently. The sheet locks the moisture in and doesn't leave a sticky residue. It's a great hydration and brightening mask. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
Easydew 2-Step Face Contour Sheet Mask - Tightening & Anti-Aging & Hydrating Korean Face Mask with DW-EGF, Hyaluronic Acid for Anti-Winkle, Reducing Fine Line & Producing Collagen (Qty 5) | I really like that this mask includes special patches for the eyes and smile lines.

I love this mask. It is very hydrating and the mask is thicker than most and clings very well. The benefits last much longer than others I have used. This is by far one of my favorite masks and it’sa good deal for the price.

The item description is WIS Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Facial Mask for Women Anti-aging, Deep Hydrating, Remove Wrinkles, 24 Pack Sheet Mask for Dry and Sensitive Skin Care. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: There's a Chinese actress who attributes her perfect skin to twice-daily sheet masks. After using one per night for several months, I totally believe they work. This mask is the best for hydration. It can be used by all skin types. The sheet is soft and flexible. You can stretch it as needed. I always stretch the eye holes since I have larger eyes. It also prevents the serum from dripping in your eyes. Another tip is to rub the mask on the backs of your hands before throwing it away. That skin needs special care also. The best part about this set is that you get so many masks. You can try using one nightly to see how it changes your skin. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.

If you usually wear a size 1 you will have to use a 0 instead
Mia Secret Monomer 8oz + Black Nail File Emery Boards Top-quality (100/180 Grit) - 5Pack | This monomer is OK but the smell is so strong I had to switch it out
Maestee Gel Nail Polish Set - 9 Bottles-Bright Neon Nail Polish With Glossy & Matte Gel Top Coat Base Coat Soak Off UV/LED Nail Lamp 0.28oz Set-C | [[VIDEOID:d22a245f18765de53d50ce49e43a6832]] The colors are even brighter than advertised but that’s actually a very good thing. Most of the colors are jelly instead of creme but when put over white you can hide that effect.
FUNFLOWERS Headband Wigs for Women, Wavy Long Water Wave Wigs with Adjustable Headwrap Synthetic Natural Black Glueless Machine Made 180% Density 27 Inchs | [[VIDEOID:42a6068f0ee5983e6ebbd51a8e621788]] If you were ever thinking about getting a headband wig I onehundred percent recommend this one. It’s curly, it’s long, it’s bouncy, and no matter which way you swing your head the curls will fall into place beautifully.
Biutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED | The polish wrinkled every time I cured it under a lamp. The only way to avoid that was to put super thin layers, and there’s not point in doing that. Might as well use a different polish at that point. I ordered this for the black polish and ended up enjoying it ONLY because of the glitter gels.
AORAEM Mini Nail Dust Collector Portable Suction Dust Collector Machine Handheld Table Dust Sweeper with Brush for Nail Drills Acrylic Nails (Light Grey) | This did as expected for a mini collector from Amazon. It didn’t pick up any super small pieces and it didn’t pick up any super big pieces it only picked up the smallish medium size pieces of dust. And when I opened it to clean it out all the dust just popped straight onto my hands and completely missed the trashcan

This is a nice set of 10 colored blending sponges all with an angled side. I love the sponges as they are dense.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are dense, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These are also perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />At the current price of $8.49 ($9.99 minus ...
These makeup sponges are a great value for the price. I love that so many come in the set and the assorted colors are a nice touch.<br /><br />The design of the sponges is simple. There is a flat slanted bottom I like to use for patting in foundation and the pointed tip that is great for concealing or reaching small places around the nose, eyes, etc.<br /><br />The sponges are reasonably sized, but when placed under water they expand greatly! I do think these are great for the money, but for foundation I’m not crazy about the finish it gives. The sponge is somewhat firm, so I feel like it can be hard to really sink the product into the skin, but it is great for ...
I took a gamble on this one - there was only one review before I purchased, so I wasn't sure what was going to show up!<br /><br />Well, 10 full-sized makeup blenders made of decent quality foam showed up. I like that I can use them once before washing, and at a really reasonable price. They are a little awkward in shape compared to the nicer blenders, but they still do their job well. Overall, it's a great purchase!

UMICKOO Hair Straightener,Upgraded Flat Iron for Hair With Real-Time Temperature Display And Adjustable Temperature,1 Inch (Rose Gold) | As a professional hairstylist, I wouldn't consider this a "professional" straightening iron. The cord is too short to be used in a professional setting.<br />Also, it operates in Celsius and not Fahrenheit which is confusing to me. It does have some nice features like a rotating cord that doesn't bind up. The<br />automatic shut off is another plus, as well as the lock/unlock, hanging ring, carrying case, hair clips, hot glove, rat tail comb and the LED display panel.

Body Scrubs for Women Premium Organic Nimiah Exfoliating Body Scrub with Activated Bamboo Charcoal Natural Salt Exfoliator Scrubs for Body Foot Hand Skin Care | This charcoal scrub makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I like that it has minimal ingredients and that its paraben and formaldehyde free. My skin looks better when I use this and feels like new again. I would buy this again and recommend it if your looking for a good exfoliating scrub.
Unwined By HASK Beauty GLOSS BOSS WHITE WINE Shampoo and Conditioner To Smooth And Shine All Hair Types To Protect And Restore Hair Strands And Tame Frizz - White Wine Shampoo + Conditioner | This shampoo and conditioner works great in my hair. I notice a big difference in the amount of frizz and flyaways. It feels soft and looks shiny but not greasy. The smell is great as well! I will definitely be buying more in the future!
Cancun Collection Cacao Body Bronzer – Superfood Infused Sunless Tanning Lotion with Cacao 5.1 fl.oz, For Instant Tan in 1 minute. | This bronzing lotion is like makeup for the while body. It covers all imperfections flawlessly! It's great as long as you aren't planning on getting in the water. It doesn't stay on if you do just FYI. I accidentally splashed water only skin and I had streaks of missing product. I'm still very pleased with this product and will buy it again in the future. It's great for pictures and when you want to have tanned, flawless looking skin.

This goes on easily, is not sticky or too thick and fades into your skin. The foundations slips on without any problem resulting in a finished look.
This is a really nice tinted moisturizer. I run my own eco farm full time & need a lot of sun protection. I always wear a wide brimmed Sloggers brand hat along with a natural tinted moisturizer with SPF.<br /><br />Lesentia with a SPF of 31, provides natural looking coverage & helps to keep my skin tone more even looking. It adds a nice warm touch of color that is perfect for summer wear. It performs exactly as described. It does leave a shine, so I touch it up with Organic Wear pressed powder. There are no weird ingredients or fragrances.<br /><br />Another natural tinted moisturizer I like is by Organic Wear. Organic Wear provides a very thin, light coverage that requires a little bit of pressed ...
I was a little surprised but this matches my skin tone perfectly. It also provides a decent amount of coverage.<br /> It's a little thick on my skin - I think I'll like it better in the winter when my skin is drier -during the summer heat its a little heavy. I do like the fact that it contains sunscreen which I sadly do not use often enough.<br /><br />I do really like it but it is a bit heavy. I dont generally wear makeup on a daily basis so that will take time to get used to it.
I really wanted to like this face moisturizer since I prefer using a tinted moisturizer over a foundation every day and this one on top of it also has an SPF 31 to protect your face from the sun. So to me that would be a win win situation.<br /><br />It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works very well. Unfortunately that is where the positive really stops in my eyes. The moisturizer is not too thick and almost runny but it isn't. It is very tinted so it kept up on that promise. I did NOT like the smell of it at all and that scent actually does linger while you apply it and some time after so that was definitely a bit no ...
I love L’esentia, and this product did not disappoint! I have been using it each day since it arrived. The SPF is perfect for summer, and the coverage is great without being heavy or weighing your skin down. I would recommend this to anyone!
Barb: I'm not so sure if I like wearing this L'esentia Tinted Moisturizer. The SPF 31 is supposed to be great if out in the sun, but this product doesn't really feel like it's absorbed into my face, leaving it shiny. I don't want it dripping down into my eyes! If I happen to touch my face it leaves a slick film on the fingers, and I worry about touching anything else and leaving a smudge of the tint. The moisturizer has an unusual scent when applied, smelling like natural clay. Maybe that's the Zinc Oxide? After a while it's not quite as noticeable. I usually use a same brand moisturizer with SPF 15 and the liquid foundation also SPF 15, and they appear to be much ...

Target: I like this tinted moisturizer for the most part but I do wish it had more coverage. It's a but too sheer for me. It does a great job moisturizing without clogging my pores and gives me plenty of UV protection as well. I like that I can reapply after a few hours and it doesn't get cakey or crumbly. All in all, it's a good moisturizes of your looking for a minimal blemish coverage.

Hand Sanitizer Dearskin Alcohol 75% Based Gel Infused with Aloe Vera 2oz/60ml, Skin Care Natural Antibacterial, Refreshing Moisturizing, Pure Disinfection, Small Hand Sanitizer (3 Pack) | These small bottles of hand sanitizer are part of the new normal. They are the perfect size to keep in a desk drawer or car. The product is thick so I don't accidentally spill it and it does not seem to dry out my skin. Even after they get the vaccine, I will probably keep these handy because colds and the flu aren't any fun either.
Travel Bottles Keychain, 1.7oz/50ml Portable Hand Sanitizer Bottles, Fine Mist Spray Keychain Bottles, Empty Leakproof Refillable Containers with Flip/Spray Cap Plastic Travel Bottles (5PC) | Pros- carabiner to attach to purse or backpack, choice of spray or flip top<br />Cons- Flip top is hard to open<br /><br />It is likely that after repeated use, the flip top will become easier to open. But when they are new, the plug that completes the seal has such a tight fit that I can barely flip it open at all. I guess I will never have to worry about it leaking! In addition to the obvious use for hand sanitizer, these can be used for sunscreen or travel toiletries like shampoo or non-aerosol hairspray.
AuroTrends Makeup Remover Towel,2 Pack Reusable Chemical-free Microfiber Makeup Remover Cloths,Magically and Gently Wipe Away Cosmetics,Sunscreen,Oil and Dirt,Set of 2 (Pink+Black) | This is basically a long rectangle of fleece fabric with a finished edge. How that cleans makeup without any soap, I couldn't tell you. But it does! I just barely dampen one small section with plain tap water and am able to wipe away liquid foundation, eye shadow and mascara. I use a different section for the next day and toss the cloth in the wash at the end of the week. I confess, that I don't normally wash my face at night. I hate using those prepackaged make up remover wipes. Single-use disposable products seem wasteful and environmentally unfriendly to me in general plus they are just like a cold slap on your face right before bed. Even if I use cold water on this cloth, ...
Hair Straightener, Flat Iron for Hair Styling, 2 in 1 Hair Curling and Straightening Tool, Non-Damage Floating Ceramic Plates, Adjustable Temperature 300°F-450°F for All Hair Types and Lengths | This is the 2nd hair straightener I've had the opportunity to try. The other is the Furiden Professional Hair Straightener Titanium Flat Iron. I'm going to write this review as a comparison between the two since they are in the same price range. For starters, both heat up quickly, have variable temperature settings, automatic shut off and a swivel cord. The Autenpoo (who comes up with these brand names???) brand has a mechanical on/off switch that also serves as the heat selector. I prefer this over the Furiden which has on/off buttons and up/down buttons to set the temp on a digital screen. If I want, I can leave the Autenpo's dial set on the temp I want (the lowest setting it has), unplug it when I'm ...

Target: Citrus is my favorite scent when it comes to beauty products.  Or cleaning products for that matter....  It just brightens up my mood in a way that a floral scent can't do.  This lotion has a decent citrus smell to it with a touch of a sweet undertone.  It moisturized my winter-dry skin well without being sticky.  Sadly, the price puts it in the "splurge" category for my budget.

Rhinestone Padded Headband Handmade Baroque Velvet Padded Lining Hair Hoop Bridal Wedding Wide Headwear Accessories For Women (gold rainbow) | I am disappointed in these hair bands. When they arrived, the gold band was stretched to be much bigger around than the multicolored band. I thought the gold one was probably of no use but it actually fit my head and stayed in place.

I lost several strands of hair trying to get it off my head.<br /><br />Looking closer at the bands, they are made differently and that is why one appear to be stretched out.

It is large enough to see my entire face and yet takes up just a small amount of room when closed. I can even slide it into my desk drawer that is only three inches deep. It has a stand that is part of the frame so I can have it standing and don’t have to hold it. The mirror itself has no distortions and is crystal clear.<br /><br />With no bells and whistles, this is just a simple mirror, but a nice size and the easel holds it up without falling.
Organic Sweet Almond Oil and Fractionated Coconut Oil Bundle for Hair and Skin, 100% Pure and Natural, Hexane-Free, Moisturizing, For Healthy Skin, Silky Hair, Multiuse Body Oil, 16 fl. Oz X 2 | My oils arrived in bottles with security seals beneath the lids. Each bottle has a cap but a pump accompanies each bottle as well. I much prefer the pumps for oils since they are thinner and it can be difficult to control a pour. During the winter months I use these oils as skin moisturizers. When still damp from a shower, I rub the oil on my skin and it moisturizes much better than any type of lotion that I have tried.<br /><br />These oils also make wonderful body scrubs using essential oils for scent and sugar or salt for the exfoliating. Using the scrubs also helps to moisturize.<br /><br />I found the oils to be fresh, no sign of a rancid smell. They both come in ...
12 Sheets 3D Iridescent Butterfly Nail Art Stickers for Fingernail Toenail, Self-Adhesive Butterfly Nail Decals, Holographic Glittery Butterfly Nail Decorations for Women Girls | These iridescent butterflies add another dimension to my nails. They can also distract or cover up some not so prefect spots. They stuck quite well to the top coat and then I put another top coat over them for security. I found them easier to apply to the wider and flatter nails, my thumbs.<br /><br />This is a nice assortment of colors and types of butterflies. There should be something to match pretty much any color.
Specific Beauty Skin Brightening Pads, Skin Smoothing for more Even Texture & Tone- Dark Spot Fading Kojic Acid & Licorice 90 X 2 180 Pads | Review for Specific Beauty Skin Brightening Pads, Skin Smoothing for more Even Texture & Tone- Dark Spot Fading Kojic Acid & Licorice 90 X 2 180 Pads<br /><br />I received on jar of skin brightening pads. Sometimes only partial orders are received by reviewers in the Vine program so I was not concerned with that. However, there is another reviewer that also only received one jar so I felt that I should mention that.<br /><br />My jar arrived with a security seal beneath the lid. Once removed, I was able to pull out a few pads. I found it difficult to separate them so that I only got one to use on my face. It turns out that every time I use these, I have to fight ...
4th of July Nail Art Stickers Decals Patriotic Designer Nail Stickers 3D Nail Art Supplies Self Adhesive American Flag Heart Star Lips Butterfly Flame I Love America Nail Stickers (8 Sheets) | Review for 4th of July Nail Art Stickers Decals Patriotic Designer Nail Stickers 3D Nail Art Supplies Self Adhesive<br /><br />This is a nice and varied set of patriotic nail stickers. You get 8 sheets so there are a lot to choose from. They are quite thin and delicate and need to be handled carefully or they will tear. I found them best handled with tweezers. They do stick well but I still put a top coat over any stickers that I use.

Target: Review for: Dry Weightless Hair Texture Spray | Hair Spray for Fine Hair | Dry Texture Spray for Hair | Hairspray for Women & Men, Hair Styling Products | Texturizing Spray | Sulfate and Cruelty Free 244ml (7oz)<br /><br />This spray is definitely lightweight. It does not make your hair sticky or stiff. It also does not hold as well as hairspray that is heavier of course. The can is easy to use with complicated spray nozzle that is hard to figure out.

Shower Cap – 2 pcs Large Shower Cap – 15 inch Extra Large Shower Cap for Women – Waterproof Polyester Design with Inner Satin Layer - Adjustable Shower Cap with Buckle and Tightening Belt | I’ve been looking for a shower cap for a long time that is sturdy, the right size and doesn’t wear out after a few uses. This is promising although it’s bigger than I need/want - I’ll still use it until something better comes along. It is adjustable so it’s very usable just way oversized for my head and the amount of hair I have. It is lightweight and water proof and dries quickly so other than size, it’s great.
Aloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz) | This is a great Aloe Gel. I keep in the fridge and use it regularly. It’s light enough weight that it doesn’t feel goopy and washes off clean. Very thick, nice and cold from the fridge and it’s great for too much sun or too much kitchen (burns, cuts, grease spatters, etc.). Easy to use - no nasty smell and works.
Gnker Cellulite Remover Massager Brush Hair Mask 5 Seconds to Restore Soft Deep Conditioner Magical Hair Treatment Mask for Dry Damaged | Once I got comfortable using this, the hand part felt weird at first, I've seen decent results. I do use a cellulite gel and this brush and I can really see an improvement. I used the same combination a couple years ago and was very happy with my results but I fell by the wayside - I'm back and I'll continue to use it forever. Between the gel and the brush, the action of using the brush is the most important and I noticed results after a couple of weeks.
Jade Roller Microneedle Derma Roller 3 in 1 for Face Massager Tools Set, Beautlinks Real Natural Rose Quartz for Anti Aging Relaxing Eye Puffiness Wrinkles for Face Eyes Neck Body | I've been watching as every personality is raving about rose quartz and jade and microneedling etc. I did some research (from reputable sources) and there is actually some science to the use of these products. The microneedle blade is small enough for use. It makes little tiny, non-noticeable holes in the surface of your skin (in effect damaging it) so it will produce more collagen. While I wouldn't use it more than once a week, and just until my skin starts to get red, it does appear that my skin is softer and smoother after the treatment. So I'm find on the micro-needler. (Just remember gently, gently). The quartz roller is supposed to reduce redness, smooth the surface of the skin and help with lymphatic drainage. I'm ...
Face Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape | There are a number of this type of product on the market and this one does not compare favorably to any others that I’ve tried. They don’t hold well and I didn’t notice any improvement. I’ll keep shopping.
Mens Sea Facial Detox Facial Mask Sheet for Oily Skin- New Skincare - Blackhead, Pore Cleansing, Peel-off (Age under 35) | I wasn't really sure about this and when I first opened it I became even more skeptical. It looked like a paper towel and I had to wet it? Fortunately I thought ahead and opened it before soaking it in water and it was relatively easy to handle. I didn't love wearing it for 30 minutes, I got annoyed by then with the masque but 20 minutes was about my limit and I did see results. I liked the masque overall and it seemed to improve the tone and texture of my skin. I knocked off a point because it was a bit cumbersome to use and waiting around for 30 minutes seemed too much for me. I've got very sensitive skin and this was not of ...

I needed a spray bottle for my pet carpet cleaning solution and this one fit the bill. It holds a good amount of solution (the one that came with the machine was too small) and it sprays evenly and thoroughly so we don't waste too much.
made of durable, strong plastic; not flimsy or squeezable like cheaper plastic bottles..nice size and shape. twist open/close spray nozzle. good height, so won’t topple over, even when empty.
It give a mist and the color is just what I was expecting.
Used this spray bottle with water in it to iron clothes. Initially I thought it only had a stream and off option despite what the descriptions say, but if you turn the nozzle slightly from the off position, you'll be able to get a mist from the water bottle when you spray. I used this for ironing and if I were to use the bottle for cleaning, I'd use the stream option. Be careful not to turn the nozzle too much or else when you spray it, it will stream, but water will also sprinkle out from the bottle's nozzle and run down your finger(s). I like the size and shape of it as I can store it in the laundry room and not have to worry ...
Got this bottle to just have water for when I need to dampen my hair before adding products. It works great and does what it needs to, also arrived very well packaged!
Worked great....for two months. Then the squeezy handle mechanism became loose and finally broke away, rendering it useless. Didn't expect longevity....but definitely thought it would last longer than it did.

Target: I’m using this for my body oil and it’s working perfectly. I wasn’t sure it would go through the sprayer but it does and it makes it so much easier to use. It’s a bit messy getting it started (oil you know) but once I got it primed, it’s working fine and I can spray when I finish in the shower and reach my back without help.

4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Natural Waterproof Mascara Extra Long Lash,Thick Thickening and Lengthening, No Clumping, No Smudging, Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Mascara | I'll confess that I set this up to compete with my favorite mascara (I've strayed from it a handful of times over the last 20 years, but always keep returning).... and it did an OK job. It works best with more than 1 coating, but does a decent job of getting the tiny lashes coated, covers things pretty well, has a few clumps (but they're pretty minimal), and stays on well (thank you, waterproofing). Overall, it does what I'm looking for in a mascara, for a price that's pretty incredible
AuroTrends Makeup Remover Towel,2 Pack Reusable Chemical-free Microfiber Makeup Remover Cloths,Magically and Gently Wipe Away Cosmetics,Sunscreen,Oil and Dirt,Set of 2 (Pink+Black) | I thought this product seemed a bit ridiculous but decided to try it anyway, and am glad I did. I have no idea how it works as well as it does, but somehow it has more "grip" on makeup than a normal washcloth, while being 100 times softer (and not having that horrible "microfiber" feel). I love wiping my face off with this warm cloth each day, and am always surprised how it even removes 95% of my waterproof mascara. I've compared eyemakeup removal by using this on one side and my liquid "eye makeup remover" on the other, and the two sides typically look nearly the same, though I look a teensy bit better on this side... so if I follow up by removing the rest ...
Spa Grade Jade Roller for Face with Gua Sha | Jade Face Roller Massager | Jade Facial Roller | Face Roller Massager | Jade Rollers | Wrinkle Roller | UPDATE: I still don't know how long this will last, but 2 months in I love this roller (store it in my freezer and use it every day), so I'm upgrading to 5 stars from 4.<br /><br />This jade roller manages to feel cool almost any time of day, which is great for reducing puffiness. It looks precisely as pictured, and comes with a storage bag and sweet uplifting note (unexpected and appreciated, even though I know everyone gets one). **If** it were a paint roller (and it's not), I wouldn't be entirely happy with how smoothly it rolls--it's decent but feels like the bearings could be a bit more reliable--but I'm not planning to subject it to heavy-duty work and even if it wobbles the tiniest ...

Smells like laundry detergent. I was pretty scared of using it on my skin. It does feel nice after but I am unsure of this product.
It's got to be the Calendula oil that leaves your skin so moisturized after using this soap. I first smelled the very subtle fragrance and thought I'd enjoy this soap enough to purchase it again till I also realized it's really moisturizing. I think you'll be very happy with how it leaves your skin feeling most of all. It's advertised as being all natural as well so if you have sensitive skin, you shouldn't have any problems with this although I'd always recommend trying a test patch first before using it in the shower all over.
Great soap with mild natural scent. Works great on my sensitive skin. Leaves it soft and clean and doesn’t dry it out.
I'm a big fan of any thing coconut from lotion to body wash to cooking oil so am always up to trying something new. I opened this soap intentionally with my usual coconut soap for side to side comparison. Over all it lathered well and had a softer/smoother feel to it. The scent was very subtle with very little hint of coconut when compared to my usual which had a definite coconut fragrance. Overall I liked the soap quite well and will use until done then switch back to compare longer term. The main hold back for me is the price which seems a little steep for an everyday soap bar.
It's soap that cleans you and doesn't overly dry out your skin. It does smell nice without being overwhelmingly sweet/floral/oddly chemically synthetic...so its nice. Your skin doesn't feel like a dried up piece of parchment paper after using and its clean so WIN WIN.
I have tried a lot of different types and brands of soap and this one is a stand out for me. I love everything about it beginning with it’s scent. The scent for some reason gives me a warm fuzzy feeling and makes my morning showers feel just a bit nicer.<br /><br />I like the shape of the soap very much because it makes the bar easier to hang onto in the shower.<br /><br />The soap lathers very well and leaves my skin feeling clean and like it has been pampered.

Target: Whoa nelly. I've been known to buy a soap or two just because it makes my bathroom smell good, even though I normally go with unscented. This is the opposite of that. It's not a bad smell, but smells like SOAP (maybe like Irish Spring if you remember that from your grandpa's bathroom decades ago?), and it will make your entire house smell the same way. It's much too strong

BEPHOLAN Facial Skin Massager For Slimming Firming Reduce Wrinkles and Skin Rejuvenate | This is a nice quality rose quartz facial roller. The massaging feature is nice and relaxing. There is a AA battery already installed (I didn't know that until I just happened to turn it on and it started vibrating). I wish the on/off was actually printed or engraved onto the handle. It's just a little gold sticker that could easily fall off if wet or from regular use. To remove/replace the battery you have to turn it to the "on" position and keep turning until the cap comes off. I wish the large roller actually rolled easily. The stone is smooth so it does glide over my skin nicely and with the vibration on, I can't even tell that the stone isn't actually rolling. The smaller stone ...
BJÖRN HALL Button Knotted Nurse Headbands for Women with Buttons | Ear Saver Headband with buttons | Headband with Buttons for Face Mask for Nurses & Doctors | Elastic Hair Band with Buttons | Protect Your Ears with this Headband | Floral Blue | This is a cute twisted knot headband. The button placement is fine for my mask but it could easily be adjusted to your liking with some basic sewing skills. The fabric is soft and stretchy. I would've liked it to be slightly smaller to begin with because it does feel like it will get stretched out too easily with prolonged use. It is a bold pattern but with the mixed colors, it would be easy to coordinate with different scrubs. This definitely helps alleviate discomfort on your ears from wearing facemasks.
BJÖRN HALL Nurse Headband with Buttons for Face Mask | Elastic Swimsuit Material, Smooth & Stretchy | Ear Saver Headband with Buttons | Perfect for Nurses, Doctors & Medical Students | This is a nice simple headband that's made out of stretchy swimsuit material. It is single layered so you won't get too warm wearing it. The part that goes behind the back of your head is narrower than the part that goes above your forehead. I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only ...

I’ve used this every day since I got it this week. I put it in the fridge then a bit of lotion on my skin. It feels amaiJg. I feel like my skin has a nice glow but it’s hard to know if it’s doing more than that. But it does feel so good like rollers meant for muscles. It makes my face Feel Relaxed and looks great
The best jade roller and Guasha tool the packaging was amazing and the quality of the product was too good compared with other brands , it also had some manual of instructions which is useful . It was really doing the job of soothing and calming after using it and the Guasha is showing good results of glow I used it only 2 times but I can see the difference in my face it has given me glow and drained the skin and the best for blood circulation in the face totally in love with this the worth for money

The item description is GOGALLJUG Jade Roller and Gua Sha,100% Natural Jade Facial Body Eyes Neck Massager Tool Reduce Wrinkles Aging. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: This is a nice jade facial roller and Gua Sha. Both ends roll smoothly and the Gua Sha is smooth all around. I do wish the stone itself in both pieces felt even smoother, I can feel slight texture in the stones in some spots (it's just not as smooth as a rose quartz roller and Gua Sha that I have but maybe that's just the nature of the stone itself).  Otherwise the stone does feel nice on my face especially when it's taken out of the fridge so it feels cool and refreshing.

Output: Good

Annie Soft Twist Rollers 7" 10 pcs Purple, Perfect for styling your hair, hair style, perm, rods, curls, hair curl, hair perm, long hair, curly hair, straight hair, for all hair types, flex rods, soft material | These are the best jumbo bendy rollers/Flexi rods I have ever used ! They are so easy to use and give such gorgeous waves (Just like what you would get if you had done a rollerset on your hair). You get those gorgeous, wide, spiral curls that would compliment anyone. They bend quite easily, which is a surprise since I have heard jumbo flexi rods are difficult to bend. You do have to have long hair in order to use them properly.<br />It will also hold better if you have thick hair with texture to it. Bone straight hair won't hold too well. I highly recomment these, there are my new faves !
NYX Liq Suede LipstickVintage, 1 Count | This colour is so beautiful ! I was looking for something similar to Anastasia Beverly hills lipsticks (can't spend $30 on a lipstick). This was sold for cheaper. It looks a lot like Vamp from ABH. It's a gorgeous matte colour. It has become one of my favorite !
La Femme Blush-on Rouge-Russet | I was expecting it to be matte but instead it's full of sparkles, which I hate. It's also too powdery, which makes a mess everywhere if you are not careful. this also causes you to use too much product...in the end wasting so much of it. The colours are pretty, but way lighter than what I expected. It's an okay product. Not surprised, when you look at the price it is sold for.
(3 Pack) NYX Butter Lipstick - Licorice | This colour is very pretty, my mother and I love it so much Love NYX lipsticks. It's very soft and moisturizing, hence the name butter lipstick. Would definitely recommend.
Soft'n Style Large Butterfly Clamps, 12 Count | I have had them for the past 3 years and they are still as good as new. They hold my thick hair in place, perfectly. They are really good quality. I would recommend them.
La Femme Blush-on Rouge-Sienna | It's lighter than I what I expected but it's a very pretty color. I very much like it. The only problem is that it's very loose and can cause quite a mess if not careful.

While this Aoraem collector can pick up some small particles, the suction it produces isn’t that great, so it leaves a lot behind. If you add the small hose attachment, then its suction power lessens even further. It was doing a halfway decent job at cleaning my keyboard, but the attachment kept falling off. The little bristles aren’t really helping anything and they are very harsh on my large mouse pad, which is what I mostly use these for. My old collector has a small lever you push to turn it on. The Aoraem requires you to turn the entire top half of the unit to power it. That’s fine for turning it on, but when you try to turn it off, it can loosen the bottom ...
I wouldn’t call it a dust collector rather a small vaccum . But it got the job done

For Beloved Girl Extreme Moisture Mineral Cloud-Silk Facial Treatment Mask for Sensitive Skin, Dry Skin, Prevents Skin From Dehydration & Prolongs Skin's Moisturizing Ability (25g x 1PC) | This sheet mask felt lovely on the skin. The sheet mask is thick and generous with serum. The serum was gentle and did not cause any sensitivity or irritation. The mask itself hydrates deeply and stayed damp for over 20 minutes. It left my skin feeling soft and pampered.
OGANA CELL Peptide Concentrating Amazing Lotion 2.03 fl.oz. (60ml) - 650ppm Peptide Contained Mild Moisturizing Facial Lotion, Hypoallergenic Natural Ingredients for Sensitive Skin | I'm always interested in trying new skincare products, brands, and innovations. I'm new to the Ogana Cell brand but knowing that the brand is created by a South Korean dermatologist caught my attention. I have had very good experience with South Korean skincare at different price points.<br /><br />This Amazing Lotion has a light texture, similar to a serum. I have combination sensitive skin and need anti-aging products. I found that this worked very well for me. There is a light fruity scent but the lotion doesn't feel sticky or oily and is quickly absorbed into the skin. It looks matte but hydrates well and left my skin feeling very soft. The lotion strengthens the skin barrier but doesn't have the slightly oily feel of many products ...
Meetory 6 Pieces Korean Exfoliating Bath Washcloth, 2 Sizes Exfoliating Bath Cloth Towels Scrub Mitten for Skin Massage, Removing Dry Dead Skin Cells, Cleaning Pores(Blue Green Yellow Pink) | These exfoliating mitts are strong but work well. They're Korean style exfoliating mitts which are different from the usual drugstore type. They're made of lightweight material that dries quickly but shouldn't be put in the dryer. They are also much rougher than the regular ones and provide excellent if strong exfoliation. I usually use them on dry skin first and then wet them with shower gel for maximum effect. I rinse them out and airdry them. They help keep skin soft.
Dr. Au Anti-Aging Face Oil Retinol Serum by Au Natural Skinfood - Promotes Youthful, Glowing Skin | Collagen Boosting Wrinkle Repair | No Oily Residue - Just Soft to the Touch Skin | Day & Night Moisturizing treatment for Men and Women | I've used retinol products, both OTC and prescribed by my dermatologist. I've been careful to only use retinol at night and to avoid direct sunlight after using retinol. This serum does not specifically warn against going under direct sun, but it is worth taking the precaution.<br /><br />I liked the texture of the Face Oil Retinol Serum - it feels like a dry oil and is easily absorbed into the skin. It doesn't feel oily or sticky but it moisturizes. It helps improve the firmness and tone.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and did not experience any redness, irritation, or sensitivity using this.
ZEROID Dermanewal Revitalizing Ampoule Korean Dermocosmetic | Restore Energy to Stressed Out Skin | (30mL | I'm new to the Zeriod brand but have had very good experience with Japanese and Korean skincare brands and products. This Zeriod Dermarenewal Revitalizing Ampoule is geared towards sensitive and combination skin. The tube is small but I only need a little drop. The ampoule is quickly absorbed into the skin and protects and hydrates. It is for additional protection to the skin after a procedure, so I don't use it daily. Instead, I would use it after a facial or an intense exfoliation.
SAMYANG ABOUTME Red Recipe Super Cleansing Balm 3.04 oz. (90ml) - Soft Melting Milk Texture Makeup Cleansing Balm, Mineral Contained Nourishing & Soothing Cleansing, Rose Scented | This cleanser comes in a simple, colorful, & attractive red-and-white package. It spreads well over the skin and has a light feel. A little of it really goes a long way.<br /><br /> It is easy to remove and makes one feel fresh and clean after application.<br /><br />The one drawback is that instructions are not given in English (only in Korean) so one is left unsure whether it needs rinsing or wiping it up with tissue is enough. There needs to be an English translation on the box in order to reach the international market.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
This sheet mask was just okay for me. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t irritate anything. It was moisturizing, however maybe a bit too much for me. It felt like once I removed it that the leftover serum took a while to absorb, even after trying to help pat it in. Maybe in the winter it would be better, but in the humidity here it just seemed a bit heavy and made it difficult for anything else to sink in afterward. The mask itself was a bit bit and not the best fitting, however I didn’t have any problems with it staying on. I think the value of this product is good for the price. If you have really dry skin you would probably like this better.
This is one of the best masks I've used in a while! It was slightly bigger than some, but you can easily fold over to fit. Holes for eyes and mouth were perfect size, and fits well over the nose! No unpleasant fragrance and lots of essence. The best part is that it doesn't leave your skin feeling even 1% sticky after taking it off! Great quantity for the price as well...definitely recommend!
I feel comfortable using these masks every day. They really are mild to the skin but so refreshing. Each mask has more than enough fluid, so much that there is a lot left over to rub on my neck, hands, and arms. Also, the fluid it thicker than water, a tiny feel of a gel, so an hour afterwards, my face still feels moisturized.
I have tried a few products by this company that I didn’t cere for because of the synthetic fragrance added to their sensitive skin products. This one is the first that did not say it was for sensitive skin, but also has no added fragrance. There is a light scent due to the regular ingredients.<br /><br />I like that this mask helps replenish the skin’s normal pH level and has good, quality ingredients for moisturizing the skin. Comes with 10 sheet masks you wear for 15-20 minutes and is similar to other Korean sheet masks. What I don’t like is that the mask is extra wide and covers a lot of my hair area. It also bags more than other masks around the nose area, so I ...
I’ve been using these face masks every night for the past week and not really a big difference but they do leave my face feeling super soft , it’s a great product but I’m open to try different masks and maybe will be purchasing again.
Love the way my face feels after this mask - super moisturized, smooth, and velvety. They are unscented as far as I can tell. There’s a good amount of leftover juice in the packets, which I put on my face after using. It’s so moisturizing that I don’t even need to apply face cream until the next day.

UNNY CLUB Cover Glow Cushion 0.3 Oz / 11g Beige Color SPF50+, Flawless Gloss Cushion Powder Complex Single Layer Concealer Cover Moisture Essence Tight Fit, Korea Cosmetics (No.23 Natural Beige) | This is a great container with a nice mirror. I love this new style of makeup. It’s just not enough converge for me. Someone young would love it I’m sure. But my skin is too uneven toned and spotty for it. If you like light coverage you will probably like it.
UV LED Nail Lamp Mercase,72W Gel uv light for Fingernail & Toenail Gel Based Polishes – Portable Nail Curing Light with 36pcs LEDs, 4 Timer Settings & Smart Sensor (White) | This is pretty good for the price. It’s easy to use. Not the most powerful but not the least either. I think it says 72W. Some are in 30s and I’ve seen some in 100s. It doesn’t get too hot as to burn you. All in all I’m happy.
Magnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, Invisible Magnetic Mink Magnetic Lashes Kits with 2 Liquid Eyeliner 6 Reusable Waterproof False Eyelashes, Eyelash Tweezers, Best Magnetic Eyeliner for Daily, Party | I love these. I like that they are mink. And I especially like how they have the little case with a mirror. That’s impossible to find. They work great and stay on my whole 12 hour shift. They are waterproof and you can’t scrub off with just water, not that a person would try. Cold cream works ok. But if you get some lash cleaner or makeup remover and apply to the end of a cotton swab and gently rub along lash, they practically fall off in seconds. At first, I was peeling them off because I thought since it’s magnetic that’s all that’s sticking. But then it’s hard to get the eyeliner off. After using a remover it’s much better. Don’t worry if you have trouble ...
Headbands for Woman Pearls Headbands,Logiverl 2PCS Pearls Headband Elegant Hair Clip Hairpins Headwear Barrette Styling Tools Accessories for Christmas Gift | These headbands are really pretty, especially for a dressy occasion. They are well made, nice and thick padded, with suede underside. Very comfortable to wear for long periods without getting a headache. I would recommend.
Liquid Foundation Makeup Sunscreen 2 Pcs 35ml Waterproof Oil Control Moisturizing Lightweight Non Stick Concealer Foundation for Face and Body in Glass Bottle with 2 Pcs Black Makeup Sponge | This was a great price. Can’t go wrong with that. However, it’s very light coverage. Which is exactly what my daughter likes so I gave it to her and she loves it. Nice sponges too.
WIS Acne Skin Pleiotropic Conditioning Face Mask Acne Scar Remover & zit Treatment & Blemish Fightting & Reduce Pores | Organic Mask Care Acne Prone skin-24 Pcs | These masks are great for oily skin. It’s a very gentle mask and feels so nice and relaxing. It is easy to apply and fits face well. Helps me to keep breakouts to a minimum, and even helps to give my skin a more even tone and appearance. I would highly recommend!

This is a nice kit with a variety of colors, finishes, and styles. I like that there are smaller bottles and more options. Must have your own UV lamp, but otherwise this kit is great!
This set brings a great selection of colors that work well for special occasions since it has neutral pinks, mauve, burgundies, blues and many shades of grays/silver. It’s my go-to set for when I need to glam up for a wedding or nighttime party.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review and photos of this product. I hope it has been helpful in providing you with more information.
I really like this set of colors as well as the base and top coat. They go on well and the glossy top coat gives a beautiful lasting shine as well. definitely a big fan
[[VIDEOID:a85cb1993222ab6477f64f176b1d9758]] Such pretty colors, I love them all!
These colors are so pretty! I love neutral tones and sparkles. The bottles are a tad small, but that's no biggie for me. The quality the gel polish is great.
This nail polish kit includes gorgeous colors, perfect for the upcoming Christmas season. Takes 2 coat to achieve a decent pigmentation. To cure it, it takes over 60 seconds. I usually apply sunscreen on the top of my hands prior to painting my nails. So far I haven't had any issues.

The item description is Veda Tinda Gel Nail Polish Kit 20 Colors Fall Winter Modern Stage Soak off UV/LED Lamp Nail Polish Set with Glossy & Matte Top Coat and Base Coat Christmas. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Love every color! So much to choose from. The odor isn’t bad on these. I think my favorite is the denim blue looking color. You can do them matte or glossy. They stay on well and go on good. It’s one of my favorite sets.

Output: This is a nice kit with a variety of colors that work well for special occasions since it has neutral pinks, mauve, burgundies, blues and many shades of grays/silver.

Pick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material) | Does exactly what it says, it's a nice sized pick that's easy to use on ones teeth (providing they have a steady hand and know exactly what they are doing). It's easy to hold in your hand, it's a good size and fits in between the gaps in my teeth well.
VIRTUE Shaping Spray, 7 oz | This hairspray works great. I rarely use hairspray but when I do I like a light hold rather than heavy. I usually use a sprax wax to tame down the frizzies but this hairspray works for that as well.<br />For the price though, I would probably go with a name brand that I know of over this one. Packaging and bottle are very nice.
LDR by Baysyx - Restorative Glow Hydro Boost Moisturizer | Nourishing Hydration Cream with Collagen Stimulation | Fortified with Hyaluronic Acid | Made in The USA from Natural Ingredients (1.7 Oz) | This is a very nice and light moisturizer that really does help hydrate your skin. What I couldn't believe was the price compared to the competition. It was excellent value and gave decent results. The fragrance is also light and doesn't over power the senses. After using this for a week I have to say my skin feels great.
Growom Garden Hose Nozzle 4 Adjustable Spray Patterns Garden Sprayer Heavy Duty Metal Hose Nozzle with 3 Washers for Gardening, Car Washing, Pet Bathing and General Cleaning | Quite impressed with this sprayer, it feels heavy duty and has a good finish on it. It comes with a few extra gaskets so there are no leaks from the connectors. The spring action handle is solid and easy to use. The adjustable spraying pattern makes it ideal to use on a large garden or on potted plants.
The Beachwaver Co. S1.25 Dual Voltage, White | awesome tool to curl your hair. Does the work for you. I can see that it would be very easy to hurt oneself while using this iron though. I would use the iron the slow setting rather than fast and rather than pushing the button down continuously , do it intermittently until the hair is curled up as far as you want it. It takes bit of practice. Iron can be very hot, so maybe start with low setting to get used to mechanisms and then once you are comfortable with the up/down and home button, ok to turn up higher.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I wasn’t expecting this hair trimmer to come in such a nice packaging. It’s very secured and not loose at all.He works beautifully and is very sturdy as well it has multiple different tips for all of my needs. I absolutely recommend it
Great trimmer for the price. The fact that you can interchange parts to the use that you need is great. I would use this more as a trimmer than as a shaver. As you can see in the pictures. The shaver trims but doesn’t give a clean shave. Again this is listed as a trimmer. And it does trim very nice. The fact that you can change the number of the trim by turning the knob is very convenient. Overall great trimmer for the price. Does not bring a charger. The cable must be plugged in to any usb charger.
This trimmer is fantastic! It's quiet and powerful and has a precision dial that lets you precisely set the trim length from very short to relatively long. With this tool, you won't need to change out removable trim guides for the lengths you want - and if you're like my guy, that also means you won't lose them constantly.<br /><br />This razor feels great in the hand and it glides without pulling on hair - that's worth five stars all by itself. It came fully charged, and it only takes about 90 minutes to completely recharge it. The big LCD readout lets you know how much power is left - it's very convenient.<br /><br />It comes with a beard trimmer, nose and ear hair trimmer, precision trimmer, ...
This multi-trimmer kit is a very useful one, and despite the listing there's nothing really male-specific about it, it's good for anyone. The rechargeable trimmer itself is a nice compact unit with a single power button and no other controls; it arrives in a locked state and turns on with a long press on the button. There's a nice variety of attachments, including a trimmer that works with the depth-adjustment dial on the base unit, a detail trimmer, a foil-electric-razor style shaver, a combination trimmer-shaver, and a nose-hair trimmer. I found they all worked fairly well. You could even do a full haircut with the main trimmer if you needed to, though it'd be a bit difficult compared to a wider trimmer. It works well on body ...

The item description is Hair Clipper Beard Trimmer Kit for Men,Cordless Hair Trimmer Mustache Trimmer Body Groomer Trimmer for Nose Ear Facial Hair with LED Display USB Rechargeable 5 In 1. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: So I thought an electric shaver would be a good option for those times I'm in a rush, don't want to spend time doing a blade shave and needed something quick and easy.  Enter this electric trimmer.  First of all, it comes with a number of attachments which seems great.  However upon further use it seems that it's just not great at shaving things, especially when the facial hair trimmer is attached.  I wasn't expecting it to be as smooth as a blade but I wasn't expecting to be left with full patches of stubble visible when I ran it over my face.  As much as I wanted to like this, it's just not a great performer for the face. The other attachments work ok, but due to the size of the razor, it's not like it's the best option for detailing work.  It's ok, just not for your face.

Output: Great trimmer for the price.

Hand Free Automatic Soap, Sanitizer Dispenser Kit - Auto Pump Station for Hand Cleaning, Include Table Stand 40oz/1200ml | So we needed an automatic hand sanitizing dispenser for a small daycare. There all so ridiculously priced right now becuase if demand that I had a hard time finding one that wasn’t insanely priced. So when I got the chance to try this Yapaspt brand automatic sanitizer dispenser kit I jumped on it.<br /><br />Setup was easy, it only took me a few minutes to do. You will need 4 size C batteries for this. I filled the included inner sanitizer holder bottle up with just some generic hand sanitizer I had gotten. Then I set it on a desk and we were good to go.<br /><br />Now I’m not sure if I just got one that the sensor isn’t very sensitive or if there’s something wrong ...
Rui Smiths Pro Stainless Steel 8-Piece Manicure Kit For Home And Salon With Professional Precision Cuticle Nipper And Metal Pusher Style No. 105 | I’ve purchased a lot of nail care kits over the years like this one from tons of different brands, getting them everywhere from drug stores to Sephora and ranging in price from 10 bucks to nearly 100 bucks. And being completely honest here this Rui Smiths pro one is a quality set especially at the price point it’s at.<br /><br />All of the pieces not only look nice but look and feel like quality and are nice and sharp. I had never heard of this brand before but decided after seeing how nice this set was I’ve ordered a few other items from them so we will see if the quality is across the board with there products. Highly recommend.
Caudalie Favorites Set | READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!!!<br /><br />So here’s the deal. Im sort of obsessed with skincare and I have lots of it. Despite what you might think because of my 1 star review, I actually LOVE a lot of Caudalie products. In fact a few of them are staples that I always make sure I have at any given time. So why the one star review you might ask?<br /><br />This set is a complete and total rip off!!! I saw that they had beauty elixir in this and jumped on it without even looking at the sizes. I assumed since it said $106 value these were gonna be at the very least deluxe travel size. No these are legit sample size. Not to mention there radiance ...

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I like that this has floating ceramic tourmaline plates. I also like that it has a fast heat up. And I like that it has the recommended heat level for different types of hair. I especially like the automatic shut off after 60 minutes and the easy restart.
Works amazingly well!! Good for course hair, was easy to use!
Works amazingly well!! Good for course hair, was easy to use!

The item description is SupSilk 1 Inch Hair Straightener Flat Iron, Flat Iron for Hair Curler Iron with Ceramic Tourmaline Plates Adjustable Fast Heat to 250-450℉ for Black Curly | Women Girlfriend Gifts | Salon. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: This is a pretty solid hair straightener considering the price point. One of my biggest pet peeves with cheaper hair straighteners is that the plates tend to not be smooth and you can feel it catching on your hair, basically a lot of times they don’t glide through like they should. However I did not have that problem at all with this one and It easily glided though my hair.<br /><br />Holding it is easy and it feels comfortable in your hand. The temp adjusts from 300F-450F, and it heats up in about a minute. It has an auto shut off after 60 min, which is a pretty long shut off time but at least it has that built in. The button to control it is on the inside which I always prefer since that means I can’t accidentally press the button as I’m using it. The only downside with this is that it’s not good for creating curls or waves like most straighteners are these days. The shape of it makes it incapable of doing this. But overall I’m happy with it.
