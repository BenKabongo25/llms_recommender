12ML Refillable Perfume Atomizer Bottle for Travel Spray Scent Pump Case Pack of 5 | [[VIDEOID:a3d7f3db939833c254ff74281c0dde18]] with the corona virus thing, i ordered this to fill with alcohol instead. i carry one in all my coat pockets and pocketbooks, so that i can spray my hands. the size is just right. you can't use up a whole thing of alcohol if went out in public. impressed with how pretty they are too. they are easy to figure out. the colors are just jackets -- you pull off the cap and the bottom so that you can unscrew the sprayer and fill it up. very good sprayer as well. not mad. i am happy. | 5.0
JPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set | love love love!<br /><br />i love how they look. you get a wide tooth and fine tooth, and most of all they are aesthetically pleasing. no tugging, they are not sharp, they don't hurt the scalp. i do recommend. | 5.0
Mountain Falls Regular Dip-It Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails, with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 9 Fluid Ounce | i love the convenience and ease of use. just dip your finger in the hole and it erases the polish like it never happened. it is potent stuff. it's basically just remover with a foam soaked inside with a bunch of incisions that you can insert your nails in. no complaints except that you will taste the fume (bitter) when you first open it. just keep it away from nose. | 5.0
BYS Kabuki Brush | It's smaller than expected. I thought it would be bigger because of the price. Is is a very soft brush and good for blending powder and buffing because it's not scratchy, I hate scratchy brushes. It's good to travel with. It also sheds a little bit at first washing. | 3.0

Natural Solution Himalayan Pink Salt Body Scrub with Natural Honey,Ultra Hydrating and Exfoliating Scrub for Nourishing Essential Body Care - 12.3 oz | This is my second scrub with this company. The first was great, but I find that the fragrance is too much for me with this Honey one. These products do contain "parfum" as an added ingredient, but it is last on the list. I have included a picture of the ingredients as I do not see the list anywhere else. My other salt scrub by this company-bloodorange, and that scent is wonderful and fresh, in bottle, in shower, and on skin after (very light). This one is just heavy, rather perfume like. I have noticed some shea containing products have that, but the other one that I do like has shea as well but isn't cloying. So I don't know. I'm afraid it might trigger a headache ... | 4.0
EASYDEW Starter Soft Conditioning Face Wash 6.76 fl oz - Soothing and Moisturizing Face Wash with Ceramides, Hydrogen Water & DW-EGF I Deep Pore Cleanser & Hypoallergenic Gentle Makeup Remover | I have been pleased with medical grade Easydew products, and this is another. It is an extremely gentle creamy cleanser and exfoliator (through enzymes). Effectively cleans my skin. Sometimes I use it after an oil cleansing, sometimes by itself. My skin never feels taut or stripped. Nor does it ever feel coated. My skin always feel simply clean and fresh.<br />Has a light fragrance- similar to other Easydew products. It doesn't bother me- no headaches or nausea. The scent dissipates quickly enough. I have no issues with this.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, fair, semi sensitive, dry, Rosacea (redness/visible veins).<br /><br />Don't need much for it to do its job. Lovely product that I would likely purchase again.<br /><br />FULL INGREDIENTS<br /><br />Water, Isopropyl Myristate, Glycerin, Butylene ... | 5.0
Kneipp Shower Foam Goodbye Stress Water Mint & Rosemary 6.81 Oz | The bottle and texture is very much like a hair mousse or shaving cream, but is a wash for the body. Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream. The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents. If you have ever used mousse, hair spray, various perfumes/body sprays, air fresheners, aerosol deodorants, or shaving cream,etc.. then you are already familiar with these ingredients. They are generally recognized as safe, and are used in small, diluted quantities in skin care. Fun fact, "These ingredients are used in cosmetics and personal care products as a replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC propellants, some of which have been shown ... | 3.0
Lesentia Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 31 – Tinted Moisturizer For Face With Spf and Blemish Concealer with All Natural Ingredients like Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and Zinc* (Medium - 2fl oz) | Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says, "medium" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, "a ... | 5.0
4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Waterproof Natural Thick Fiber Mascara, Thick Thickening Lengthening, Dramatic Extension Voluminous Eyelashes Mascara, No Clumping, No Smudging Lasting All Day | I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, "made for USA but made in China", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why? Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after ... | 4.0

Altaba Long Wavy Wigs Ombre gray Wig Synthetic Wigs Middle Part Natural Looking Heat Resistant Party Cosplay Full Wig for Women | Soft. Decent quality. Very pretty coloring with the black roots and silver-gray. The length and style look pretty, too. Fits good and is styled nicely. Looks good, overall like it! | 5.0
Hemp Lotion for Dry Skin - Soothing Rose Flower & Aloe Hydrate Your Complexion - Non-Greasy, Vegan, 7Oz, 250Mg Hemp, Fragrance & Paraben Free - Guayaquil By La La Leaf | Having health issues that causes very dry skin, I appreciate a lotion with better ingredients and moisturizing. This one isn't as thick as some but it's doing the job hydrating. It's a great size too! | 4.0
Padded Rhinestone Crystal Headband Bejewled Wide Velvet Hairband Statement Bridal Wedding Party Headwear Hair Hoop Hair Accessories (rainbow) | This is definitely a statement headband! For whatever you decide to use it for, it's big (thick/height wise), flashy and very noticeable…yet very pretty and has a lot of bling 🙌🏽 My 10 year old loves it too and says it's like a queen's headband. The soft lining underneath does help make it comfortable and it fits well! | 5.0

Pick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material) | I was hopeful for this pick but disappointed. First off, it's a super flimsy and you can't use much pressure when pressing against teeth. Also, the pointed end that is supposed to clear put any food from between the teeth isn't pointed enough so you can't really get in there all the way. Last, because you cannot put enough pressure to scrape off gunk, it becomes useless. | 3.0
JPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set | I love these combs not only for myself but for my daughters hair. They are perfect for any hair length or texture as you have a set of 4 from wide tooth to fine tooth. They feel nice on the scalp and glide through hair easily. These are a great deal for 4 of these! | 5.0
Aloe Hand Sanitizer 24 Pack Dearskin Aloe Vera Moisturizing Alcohol 75% Gel 2 Fl Oz/60ml Skin Care Natural Advanced Formula Alcohol Refreshing Moisturizing with Argine. | This hand sanitizer works great. It isn't too sticky and a little goes a long way. Great value for the price. So easy to use and love the high alcohol continent to keep germs away for myself and my family! Perfect for each family member to keep in their pocket! | 5.0
The Beachwaver Co. Dual Voltage, S1, White | First off, I know it pricey for a curling iron but it actually does the trick and is pretty cool. You clip your hair in the bottom little clipper and I prefer the low speed and it winds your hair for you up the wand! It gets nice and hot and curls did stay well after hrs or wear in semi humid weather. Definitely takes a little getting use to but it’s pretty cool. You do need to take slightly smaller sections of hair to curl so the clipper can hold it but I really enjoyed using this! | 5.0
Aloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz) | We use aloe a lot in our house as my daughter is constantly scraping her knees. This aloe has a nice push too for easy use and it a pretty decent value size. No strong smell and dries fast. Great buy. | 5.0

Queendom Unlashed Mascara | Volumizing and Lengthening | Boosts Lash Length | Vegan, Cruelty Free, Paraben Free | This is a thicker formula, which I am not in love with. However; it is a nice mascara. I have never heard of this brand and the price is pretty high for an unknown brand. I like this, but I do not think I would pay almost twenty dollars for it. | 3.0
ABOUT ME MediAnswer Collagen Firming Up Mask 4ea (1box) 25g - 77% Pure Collagen Extract Anti-Aging Total Care Facial Mask Sheet, Powerful Hydrating and Anti-Wrinkle Night Skin Care | I really like using face masks every week, and these are great. I am not really sure that they do anything but they make me feel good and leave my skin feeling nice and soft. I love using them for paper nights or just when I need a pick me up. This one feels nice on and I have had no skin issues since using. | 4.0
2-Pack Puretize 16.9 Oz Hand Sanitizing Gel w/Pump Tops - Extra Strength 70% Ethyl Alcohol - Moisturizing Formula with Aloe Vera, Vitamin E & Botanical Extracts - Quick Drying Formula | Right now in the world, you are very lucky to find hand sanitizer as it is sold out everywhere. I really like this stuff! I like having these out in our home for when we touch anything from outside. We needed a larger one for the house sand not just for traveling. These work well and are strong. | 5.0
Gaming Headphones Chamvict Xbox One Headset with Stereo Sound Ps4 Headset with Mic Noise Canceling for PS4,PC,Laptop,Cell Phone,Xbox,Find Enemies Before They Find You | Headphones are so expensive now a days, so these are at a great price point.

CELLEANSER Vegan Clean Cream 100% Vegan Ingredients Hydrating Nourishing Anti-Aging Balancing Panthenol Silky Made in Korea 60ml 2.02 fl.oz. | I like this moisturizer, though I'm not 100% sure that it's for everyone. It is light, but it does take a bit more time than usual to fully absorb into the skin. It's vegan though and it has this deliciously eucalyptus clean smell. I think that makes it appropriate for people who have a little of an acne issue or for folks that are men. I happen to really like the scent. | 5.0
Vitamasques Cica Green Tea Jelly Facial Cleanser Gentle pH Cleanser is Refreshing, Cleansing & Exfoliating for Smooth, Clean & Radiant Skin - Vegan, Free from Parabens & Gluten | I like this product a lot for the vegan ingredients. it cleans without stinging my eyes. My skin feels a little more stripped than I would like it to feel. But at this price point, it's perfect. I'm just really spoiled with my skin care.<br /><br />Definitely appropriate for someone with oily skin. I will likely use it through the summer months where my workout routine might indicate that I need this. I wear make-up when I work out so I need something that really cleans afterwards. this will do the trick. | 4.0
Olive And Avocado Hair Mask For Hair Growth And Dry Damaged Hair By BACC Beauty And Care - Treatment With Natural Extracts | Deep Moisturizer | Hydrates | Repairs And Soften | Hair Mask For Dry Damaged Hair For Women And Men - 18.5 Fl Oz 550ml | I like this product! It's very moisturizing and a great supplement to keeping my long hair from splitting. There isn't any sort of crazy smell to it. It's just a neutral sort of smell. I would get this for sure. It goes with my green themed bathroom and looks like a luxury addition for the many guests that are always coming for a visit. | 5.0

VILLAGE11FACTORY Cica Cream, Centella Soothing and Repairing Cream for Dry and Irritated Skin, Moisturizer, Anti-Wrinkles, Lightweight, Relieves Irritated Skin, Fragrance Free, Dermatologically Tested, 1.69 fl oz 50ml | I have found my skin has become more sensitive in my 40s and with all the additional washing and bathing because of Covid 19. I'm new to this brand but found this Cica cream to work very well. It immediately cooled and soothed my irritated skin without any greasiness or oiliness. It was quickly absorbed into the skin. It left my skin feeling much softer, less irritated, soothed. It is something I plan to keep on hand. | 5.0
SAMYANG ABOUTME Red Recipe Super Cleansing Balm 3.04 oz. (90ml) - Soft Melting Milk Texture Makeup Cleansing Balm, Mineral Contained Nourishing & Soothing Cleansing, Rose Scented | This cleanser comes in a simple, colorful, & attractive red-and-white package. It spreads well over the skin and has a light feel. A little of it really goes a long way.<br /><br /> It is easy to remove and makes one feel fresh and clean after application.<br /><br />The one drawback is that instructions are not given in English (only in Korean) so one is left unsure whether it needs rinsing or wiping it up with tissue is enough. There needs to be an English translation on the box in order to reach the international market. | 5.0
AG Care Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar Leave On Mist | This AG Hair Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar is relatively expensive at $20 for a small bottle, but it is made of natural ingredients like apple cider vinegar, organic argan oil and protein from quinoa. The spray is supposed to refresh the scalp and the hair, to reduce irritation to the scalp and to help soften hair. I have been trying different scalp treatments and was eager to see how this would work. It is less of a scalp treatment and more of a hair refresher but it does add bounce and lift to my hair. | 4.0
BRING GREEN Super Yulmu Pore Deep Cleansing Foam 200ml - Adlay Seed Powder and Clay Contained Exfoliating Rich Foam Cleanser, Remove Dead Skin Cells & Blackeads, Moisturizing Deep Cleanser | I use a pea-sized portion which I mix until it froths. I apply the foam to my face and let it stand briefly before rinsing it off. It leaves my skin feeling deep cleansed but not squeaky dry. I have not had any sensitivity or redness or irritation. It works well with my regular toner and serum. | 4.0
Natural Jade Roller Massager & Rose Quartz Facial Roller 2pcs Gift Set | My quartz roller worked well. I washed it carefully first and then used the larger roller for my forehead, cheeks and chin. The smaller roller worked well under my eyes. I liked the feel of the rollers as they massaged my face. They did make a slight squeaky sound but they held up well. It is similar to a face massage but very easy to do while relaxing at home. At this price, it is a reasonble buy. | 4.0

Microfiber Hair Towels - 5 Towel Set – 5 Beautiful Colors - Great for all Hair Types - Size (10 x 26 inches) Lightweight, Absorbent, and Ultra Soft. Colors Rose, Pink, Gray, Blue, and Lilac. | I absolutely love these hair towels. My hair is down to the middle of my back, and they are super absorbent. When I wrap my hair in the towel soaking wet, my hair is pretty dry after about ten minutes.<br /><br />They are plenty big enough for long hair. I have no problems twisting my hair up and buttoning it. The two buttons make it even easier to button.<br /><br />I washed them in cold water in the washing machine, and dried them on low.<br /><br />After using them, I hang them up, and they dry really fast.<br /><br />The set included five towels. light blue, light purple, rose, pink and gray.<br /><br />I recommend | 5.0
LANGE HAIR Extendé Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ | I've been wanting to try Lange's products for awhile now, and I just wasn't impressed with this one. I quit using my normal after shower hair product, and started using this one instead.<br /><br />First I'm not sure if it detangled my hair or not, as I have a really good brush that doesn't pull my tangles at all if I have them.<br />The smell was super strong and gave me a migraine.<br />It did not help with frizz at all.<br />It left my hair feeling dry. | 3.0
Klavuu Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack- Overnight Exfoliating & Nourishing Lip Treatment Balm for Dry Lips - Natural Moisturizing Lip Oil with Vanilla Flavor - Lip Balm to Repair & Protect Lips 0.7oz. | I love the Klavuu lip treatment. It is really moisturizing. I use it before bed and multiple times a day. Love applying it over lip color. My lips are always soft after using it. The flavor is supposed to be vanilla, but I don't really smell or taste it.<br />Product is made in Korea. | 5.0
Natwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set. | I've gotten several different brands and sizes of reusable makeup pads and I think the little ones work the best as far as taking makeup off goes. I don't wear makeup often, but these work great for taking waterproof eyeliner off. I just soaked the pad in hot water and then wiped my eyes and the eyeliner came right off.<br /><br />They are made of microfiber material and are super soft. They are not very thick, but they do a fantastic job. The set comes with 18. 6 pink, 6 white, and 6 blue.<br /><br />Once your done using them, you can use the laundry bag provided and toss them in the washing machine or hand wash them.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these makeup pads. | 5.0
