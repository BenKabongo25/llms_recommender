Natural Solution Himalayan Pink Salt Body Scrub with Natural Honey,Ultra Hydrating and Exfoliating Scrub for Nourishing Essential Body Care - 12.3 oz | This scrub smells good. It's a very warm, comforting scent. I used this scrub in the shower after I shaved to exfoliate my legs and loved how it left my legs feeling. It's also really hydrating, so I didn't feel like I needed to immediately slather on lotion...

Does good.
Neat charcoal look, seems wild when brushing with it. More of a light powder without any grit, goes along ways. Cleans your teeth so good they feel nice and clean. Cool coconut flavor.
There are no ingredients listed on the product! Plus on the listing (I noticed too late), that the ingredients listed are “the active” ingredients, not the entire list of ingredients. While those are great. The “inactive” ingredients could be a bunch of terrible chemicals. I’m pretty sure it is illegal to sell products without a list of ingredients. This product should not be sold.
My friend used this and his teeth looked great!<br />I was so excited when it came !<br />And the price was really good to !
This truly works. Noticable results in just a day or two. Love that it doesn't taste bad either.

12ML Refillable Perfume Atomizer Bottle for Travel Spray Scent Pump Case Pack of 5 | [[VIDEOID:a3d7f3db939833c254ff74281c0dde18]] with the corona virus thing, i ordered this to fill with alcohol instead. i carry one in all my coat pockets and pocketbooks, so that i can spray my hands. the size is just right. you can't use up a whole thing of alcohol if went out in public. impressed with how pretty they are too. they are easy to figure out. the colors are just jackets -- you pull off the cap and the bottom so that you can unscrew the sprayer and fill it up. very good sprayer as well. not mad. i am happy.
JPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set | love love love!<br /><br />i love how they look. you get a wide tooth and fine tooth, and most of all they are aesthetically pleasing. no tugging, they are not sharp, they don't hurt the scalp. i do recommend.
Mountain Falls Regular Dip-It Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails, with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 9 Fluid Ounce | i love the convenience and ease of use. just dip your finger in the hole and it erases the polish like it never happened. it is potent stuff. it's basically just remover with a foam soaked inside with a bunch of incisions that you can insert your nails in. no complaints except that you will taste the fume (bitter) when you first open it. just keep it away from nose.
BYS Kabuki Brush | It's smaller than expected. I thought it would be bigger because of the price. Is is a very soft brush and good for blending powder and buffing because it's not scratchy, I hate scratchy brushes. It's good to travel with. It also sheds a little bit at first washing.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says, "medium" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, "a ...
Barb: I'm not so sure if I like wearing this L'esentia Tinted Moisturizer. The SPF 31 is supposed to be great if out in the sun, but this product doesn't really feel like it's absorbed into my face, leaving it shiny. I don't want it dripping down into my eyes! If I happen to touch my face it leaves a slick film on the fingers, and I worry about touching anything else and leaving a smudge of the tint. The moisturizer has an unusual scent when applied, smelling like natural clay. Maybe that's the Zinc Oxide? After a while it's not quite as noticeable. I usually use a same brand moisturizer with SPF 15 and the liquid foundation also SPF 15, and they appear to be much ...
This goes on easily, is not sticky or too thick and fades into your skin. The foundations slips on without any problem resulting in a finished look.
I try it and love it. Usually the SPF cream is rough but this one is sooooo smooth and nice . I am in love with it
Lesentia tinted spf moisturizer. This smells like old olive oil. I make soap so I know what a oil smells like when it is no longer good and this smells just like that. It is oily and greasy and smells terrible. It didnt dry out my skin but I couldn't wear it for long due to the oil smell. It seems to lightly give some tinted coverage but not much. If the oils were not so strong smelling and much fresher I think this might be ok to use. The expiration date is listed as being 3/31/22 so I am surprised at the low quality of oils used and that they are no longer very good.

The item description is Lesentia Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 31 – Tinted Moisturizer For Face With Spf and Blemish Concealer with All Natural Ingredients like Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and Zinc* (Medium - 2fl oz). What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: i wanted to like this but i can't. it has coverage like a light coverage foundation but too dark in color, if you are very tan yes the color would work. i can't believe this is a "moisturizer" because it is super thick and sticky, it feels so heavy on the skin, it doesn't set or feel dry after unless you powder it. i can work with the color, i just don't like how this feels, your skin will feel warm and sticky. it's a shame because there is a lot in the bottle. if you want this for the coverage, might as well buy a bottle of foundation.

Output: smell like old olive oil.

Natural Solution Himalayan Pink Salt Body Scrub with Natural Honey,Ultra Hydrating and Exfoliating Scrub for Nourishing Essential Body Care - 12.3 oz | This is my second scrub with this company. The first was great, but I find that the fragrance is too much for me with this Honey one. These products do contain "parfum" as an added ingredient, but it is last on the list. I have included a picture of the ingredients as I do not see the list anywhere else. My other salt scrub by this company-bloodorange, and that scent is wonderful and fresh, in bottle, in shower, and on skin after (very light). This one is just heavy, rather perfume like. I have noticed some shea containing products have that, but the other one that I do like has shea as well but isn't cloying. So I don't know. I'm afraid it might trigger a headache ...
EASYDEW Starter Soft Conditioning Face Wash 6.76 fl oz - Soothing and Moisturizing Face Wash with Ceramides, Hydrogen Water & DW-EGF I Deep Pore Cleanser & Hypoallergenic Gentle Makeup Remover | I have been pleased with medical grade Easydew products, and this is another. It is an extremely gentle creamy cleanser and exfoliator (through enzymes). Effectively cleans my skin. Sometimes I use it after an oil cleansing, sometimes by itself. My skin never feels taut or stripped. Nor does it ever feel coated. My skin always feel simply clean and fresh.<br />Has a light fragrance- similar to other Easydew products. It doesn't bother me- no headaches or nausea. The scent dissipates quickly enough. I have no issues with this.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, fair, semi sensitive, dry, Rosacea (redness/visible veins).<br /><br />Don't need much for it to do its job. Lovely product that I would likely purchase again.<br /><br />FULL INGREDIENTS<br /><br />Water, Isopropyl Myristate, Glycerin, Butylene ...
Kneipp Shower Foam Goodbye Stress Water Mint & Rosemary 6.81 Oz | The bottle and texture is very much like a hair mousse or shaving cream, but is a wash for the body. Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream. The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents. If you have ever used mousse, hair spray, various perfumes/body sprays, air fresheners, aerosol deodorants, or shaving cream,etc.. then you are already familiar with these ingredients. They are generally recognized as safe, and are used in small, diluted quantities in skin care. Fun fact, "These ingredients are used in cosmetics and personal care products as a replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC propellants, some of which have been shown ...

4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Waterproof Natural Thick Fiber Mascara, Thick Thickening Lengthening, Dramatic Extension Voluminous Eyelashes Mascara, No Clumping, No Smudging Lasting All Day | I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, "made for USA but made in China", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why? Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after ...

These hair ties are a tighter tie similar to name brand like conair. Right off the packaging they are too tight tight wear around wrist but work well to hold hair in place. Haven't had any break or anything so far, so overall good hair ties so far!
It is working great for my thick hair. They hold my hair in place all day and I can slide them off easily without pulling of hair and no damage. They are stretchy and good quality ties.

The item description is Asenlin Hair Ties Bands 4MM Durable Neutral Ouchless Accessories for Women Men Girls No Metal Elastics Thick Tie with Strong Ponytail Holder and for Medium Hair(24 Count of 3 Pack)-Black. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: What doesn't work for my hair, works for my cats. That is our agreement. So these are pretty much a pack of cat toys as I prefer hair bands that fit comfortably on my wrist. These have plenty of stretch, but elastic is tight when retracted. Good or bad depending on needs. So too tight for me to keep on wrist. These are ok if I keep them tucked into a drawer and I grab one as I need one. They have good snug elasticity for thinner hair. My hair is thick, but I can use them for the ends of my hair when I put my hair in a braid. I dont like them for pulling all my hair back. These won't be a repurchase. They're "ok"

Only been using it for 2 weeks and can already see a difference
I have been using this product for almost a week now and this product really does make your eye lashes grow :)! I highly recommend this product to any female or man whom wants longer lush eyelashes !!! 100% gurenty you I love it !!!
Still in the growth process but I believe I'm seeing results in my eyebrows
easy to use...doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Have only started to use it, so I don't know how well it will work. Will update!

The item description is Eyelash Growth Serum Eyebrows Enhancer - Natural Eye Lash Brow Boost Enhancing Advanced Serum Full Eyebrow Lush Conditioner Booster Regrowth Treatment to Grow Fuller Thicker Longer Eyelashes. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I have sensitive skin and eyes.  Without the right mascara my eyes itch and my eyelids get a reaction.  I've wanted to get a lash growth serum but was reluctant because of my eye allergies.  This does not cause any reactions. I put it on both top and bottom eyelashes with no issues. I have only used it for a few days so I can't say if it works, yet.  I've taken before pics and even though it states to use it for a 30 day period I will post and update after two weeks to see the progress.

I normally use Salon shampoos because over the counter regular shampoos just dry out my hair. My hair has been colored and permed for years so if I use regular cheap shampoos my hair gets really dry and looks like straw. I decided to try this because I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion** This Argan Oil Shampoo has an amazing scent and is thick which allows you to use less of it at once even with long hair. I have long slightly curly hair which means I tend to use a lot of shampoo and as you may know leaves a nice hole in my pocketbook. This shampoo also has a pump dispenser ...
I received this for free in exchange for my biggest opinion. I was not a fan of this shampoo. I love argan oil and thought this shampoo would be hydrating. However, my hair felt VERY dry even in the shower. I used a deep conditioner after, but my hair feels stripped. Also the pump on my bottle doesn't work. I have processed hair and its been bleached so maybe if you have natural hair it would work???
This is awesome! I love to have clean hair but most shampoos dry out my hair if I use them everyday and leave my scalp itchy. This shampoo was the totally opposite. I was in a hurry so I forgot conditioner but I didn't need it. My hair was soft and bouncy. The smell is amazing. I would recommend this shampoo to all types of hair. You won't regret it. I was given this item for free for my unbiased opinion.

Target: I'm a bit of a hair product snob. Years of coloring has damaged my hair badly so I am very picky what I use on it.<br /><br />Not only is this shampoo organic and not loaded with sulfates and parabens but it has an amazing smell. Almost like a sweet cedar.<br /><br />The shampoo has a medium lather. I used 10 pumps as I have think and mid length hair. I also left the shampoo in my hair for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />After washing my hair was not greasy or heavy from residue. There was definitely a shine but no oily feel.<br /><br />I have oily roots and this shampoo cleaned my hair with easy while leaving it evenly moisturizer.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased and I definitely will be purchasing again.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item for free. My review and assessment is my own after personal use and has not been influenced or compensated.

Fluffy Wispy lashes. False lashes.
Love these lashes they are easy to put on.So comfortable you get many pairs. These lashes are wispy.There is ten pairs and you can reuse them.
These lashes are gorgeous! The lash curl looks similar to lash extensions and the shape flatters my eyes nicely. There’s a lot of lashes for the price and they’ll last me a minute. I can also reuse them if I clean them right. The lash band is comfortable and my eyes aren’t weighed down. These lashes make my eyes look lifted.
[[VIDEOID:821cf7aa15b6242e351787591d5b2a64]] The look so nice & came quickly definitely worth the money
The WT 02i lashes are the perfect pair for a dramatic cat-eye look!<br /><br />These are my first pair of big, dramatic lashes, and I find them so comfortable to wear.<br /><br />A potential downside is when I took these lashes out of the packaging, some of the outer lash bits got pulled off- so they are a little fragile.<br /><br />Other than that, the lashes stay on really well with little glue.<br /><br />I could also see myself trimming some pairs down to create different shapes. Since there are 10 pairs, I can have a variety for a fair price. But yes, the untrimmed version still looks so good!

Altaba Long Wavy Wigs Ombre gray Wig Synthetic Wigs Middle Part Natural Looking Heat Resistant Party Cosplay Full Wig for Women | Soft. Decent quality. Very pretty coloring with the black roots and silver-gray. The length and style look pretty, too. Fits good and is styled nicely. Looks good, overall like it!
Hemp Lotion for Dry Skin - Soothing Rose Flower & Aloe Hydrate Your Complexion - Non-Greasy, Vegan, 7Oz, 250Mg Hemp, Fragrance & Paraben Free - Guayaquil By La La Leaf | Having health issues that causes very dry skin, I appreciate a lotion with better ingredients and moisturizing. This one isn't as thick as some but it's doing the job hydrating. It's a great size too!
Padded Rhinestone Crystal Headband Bejewled Wide Velvet Hairband Statement Bridal Wedding Party Headwear Hair Hoop Hair Accessories (rainbow) | This is definitely a statement headband! For whatever you decide to use it for, it's big (thick/height wise), flashy and very noticeable…yet very pretty and has a lot of bling 🙌🏽 My 10 year old loves it too and says it's like a queen's headband. The soft lining underneath does help make it comfortable and it fits well!

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
This time, I am trying three different items. I am trying the Virtue cream for you neck and décolletage, the Silk moisturizing cream and the Bright lifting eye cream. Because I put other products on my face and eye area earlier, I am putting this on my hands and arm. I love the feel of the Silk moisturizing cream, the Virtue cream is thicker than your other moisturizers, and the eye lifting cream. The eye lifting cream is applied in dots so you only go around your eye area. The Silk moisturizing cream is really nice and can be used on your face daily.

The item description is MAELYS VIRTUE Neck Firming Cream. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: The skin on my neck has lost a lot of elasticity. I wouldn't say it's in bad shape but I feel it is for being in mid 30s. Having health stuff going on, former daily tanning machine user, former smoker and my weight goes up-and-down- all things that have contributed to my skin changes and my neck is no exception. This cream is soothing and leaves a lot of moisturize but not a lot of goop. I feel like my skin looks smoother, though I'm sure more consistent and long-term use will bring the most benefits and results. The texture of it is so creamy and thick and feels great on! Arrived sealed and packaged-up really well.

Pick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material) | I was hopeful for this pick but disappointed. First off, it's a super flimsy and you can't use much pressure when pressing against teeth. Also, the pointed end that is supposed to clear put any food from between the teeth isn't pointed enough so you can't really get in there all the way. Last, because you cannot put enough pressure to scrape off gunk, it becomes useless.
JPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set | I love these combs not only for myself but for my daughters hair. They are perfect for any hair length or texture as you have a set of 4 from wide tooth to fine tooth. They feel nice on the scalp and glide through hair easily. These are a great deal for 4 of these!
Aloe Hand Sanitizer 24 Pack Dearskin Aloe Vera Moisturizing Alcohol 75% Gel 2 Fl Oz/60ml Skin Care Natural Advanced Formula Alcohol Refreshing Moisturizing with Argine. | This hand sanitizer works great. It isn't too sticky and a little goes a long way. Great value for the price. So easy to use and love the high alcohol continent to keep germs away for myself and my family! Perfect for each family member to keep in their pocket!
The Beachwaver Co. Dual Voltage, S1, White | First off, I know it pricey for a curling iron but it actually does the trick and is pretty cool. You clip your hair in the bottom little clipper and I prefer the low speed and it winds your hair for you up the wand! It gets nice and hot and curls did stay well after hrs or wear in semi humid weather. Definitely takes a little getting use to but it’s pretty cool. You do need to take slightly smaller sections of hair to curl so the clipper can hold it but I really enjoyed using this!
Aloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz) | We use aloe a lot in our house as my daughter is constantly scraping her knees. This aloe has a nice push too for easy use and it a pretty decent value size. No strong smell and dries fast. Great buy.

Queendom Unlashed Mascara | Volumizing and Lengthening | Boosts Lash Length | Vegan, Cruelty Free, Paraben Free | This is a thicker formula, which I am not in love with. However; it is a nice mascara. I have never heard of this brand and the price is pretty high for an unknown brand. I like this, but I do not think I would pay almost twenty dollars for it.
ABOUT ME MediAnswer Collagen Firming Up Mask 4ea (1box) 25g - 77% Pure Collagen Extract Anti-Aging Total Care Facial Mask Sheet, Powerful Hydrating and Anti-Wrinkle Night Skin Care | I really like using face masks every week, and these are great. I am not really sure that they do anything but they make me feel good and leave my skin feeling nice and soft. I love using them for paper nights or just when I need a pick me up. This one feels nice on and I have had no skin issues since using.
2-Pack Puretize 16.9 Oz Hand Sanitizing Gel w/Pump Tops - Extra Strength 70% Ethyl Alcohol - Moisturizing Formula with Aloe Vera, Vitamin E & Botanical Extracts - Quick Drying Formula | Right now in the world, you are very lucky to find hand sanitizer as it is sold out everywhere. I really like this stuff! I like having these out in our home for when we touch anything from outside. We needed a larger one for the house sand not just for traveling. These work well and are strong.
Gaming Headphones Chamvict Xbox One Headset with Stereo Sound Ps4 Headset with Mic Noise Canceling for PS4,PC,Laptop,Cell Phone,Xbox,Find Enemies Before They Find You | Headphones are so expensive now a days, so these are at a great price point. They work perfect for gaming, especially if you are doing online gaming as they do have a microphone. They do not have too many features, but our a nice pair if you are looking for some.
Cleancult Soap Dispenser with Pump, 12oz Frosted Glass Refillable Bottle with Non-Slip Grip, Pre filled with Natural Liquid Handsoap, Lavender Scent, Eco Friendly | First off, the presentation of this is amazing. I love the look of the container. This soap is really nice. I do wish I got a little more coconut smell, but rather it has a pretty strong eucalyptus spell. It still smells amazing though.

So my boyfriend suprised me with these harry potter brushes and stitch brushes and i was so excited, i posted a photo in a group on Facebook. It was an instant hint with almost 100 ladies asking me where they can purchase. I was so impressed with the quality that i had shared this link. I am super impressed and just plain obsessed with these brushes. My boyfriend did very good and i will definitely be getting more ♡
Seriously, I'm in love with these brushes!! so well made, absolutely beautiful, i highly recommend them!
I purchased these brushes for my beat friends birthday because she loves Harry Potter. She said they were the “prettiest brushes” she had ever seen lol.

Target: If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will love these.  I am into makeup and Harry Potter, but these are definitely more so a collectors item than brushes I will actually use.  They are super, super small.  These are much smaller than I was expecting both in the wand and also in the brush itself.  I am ok with this as I did not plan to use these for makeup but it is worth mentioning in case you did plan to use them that way.

Output: Loved them

CELLEANSER Vegan Clean Cream 100% Vegan Ingredients Hydrating Nourishing Anti-Aging Balancing Panthenol Silky Made in Korea 60ml 2.02 fl.oz. | I like this moisturizer, though I'm not 100% sure that it's for everyone. It is light, but it does take a bit more time than usual to fully absorb into the skin. It's vegan though and it has this deliciously eucalyptus clean smell. I think that makes it appropriate for people who have a little of an acne issue or for folks that are men. I happen to really like the scent.
Vitamasques Cica Green Tea Jelly Facial Cleanser Gentle pH Cleanser is Refreshing, Cleansing & Exfoliating for Smooth, Clean & Radiant Skin - Vegan, Free from Parabens & Gluten | I like this product a lot for the vegan ingredients. it cleans without stinging my eyes. My skin feels a little more stripped than I would like it to feel. But at this price point, it's perfect. I'm just really spoiled with my skin care.<br /><br />Definitely appropriate for someone with oily skin. I will likely use it through the summer months where my workout routine might indicate that I need this. I wear make-up when I work out so I need something that really cleans afterwards. this will do the trick.
Olive And Avocado Hair Mask For Hair Growth And Dry Damaged Hair By BACC Beauty And Care - Treatment With Natural Extracts | Deep Moisturizer | Hydrates | Repairs And Soften | Hair Mask For Dry Damaged Hair For Women And Men - 18.5 Fl Oz 550ml | I like this product! It's very moisturizing and a great supplement to keeping my long hair from splitting. There isn't any sort of crazy smell to it. It's just a neutral sort of smell. I would get this for sure. It goes with my green themed bathroom and looks like a luxury addition for the many guests that are always coming for a visit.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
My skin is sensitive. It effectively prevents dryness with a soft and moist serum.<br />I think it's good for all skin including sensitive skin!
I have sensitive skin as MOST people identify themselves with… I get rash/acne when the skincare is not well fitting. I develop allergies to products if used for more than normal use. So it is pretty difficult to be like a nomad in going around for skincare items. I am glad I ran into this item randomly by its name of Vegan and Clean/soft materials. Only a few days of use but I don’t have any reactions to this as I would for normal new products. Go for it.
I used this later in a day, after derma rollering, and I felt it helped soothe my skin. No lingering irritation or redness from the derma roller. I'm not sure if it was this serum alone or how it worked in conjunction with my other skin care products, but my skin felt velvety soft afterwards. I enjoyed the lavender-scented milky texture of this serum. It came in a sealed box. It's affordably priced at $9.99. I would get this again.
Love this product. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I can tell a big difference in the appearance and feel of my skin, it's reduced my pores and helped with my oily skin. Also, my skin feels so hydrated and feels so smooth. I can't give this product enough stars love it. I recommend this for any skin type!
I have been using this for about 5-days. I replaced the current moisturizer to try this serum. I have dry and mature skin.<br /><br />Results;<br />1)Started to get a small reaction on my left side nostril. Starting to itch. Tiny spot.<br />2)Face felt smooth after application<br />3)used only a larger size dime, for my face<br />4)not oily<br />5)faint scent of alcohol<br />6)light feeling.

ApHogee Two-Step Protein Treatment 1oz & Balancing Moisturizer 0.75oz Packet"Pack of 2" | the best product I've ever used for severely damaged hair (I've used over 50 products).

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I love these. Have used them before. It takes a couple weeks, but they really break up the calluses and soften your feet
Love this product! It's the only thing that works on my feet!
These pads have saved my feet. I have always had issues with dry heels, and one spot in particular that has had extra callous through the years, because of a failed &#34;home pedicure&#34; experiment long ago. I have done the &#34;before/after&#34; cracked heel cream. I have loofa-ed my heels in the shower nightly. I have DONE ALL THE THINGS. The only thing that has ever helped is getting a professional pedicure where they &#34;shave&#34; the callous off. And then for a few days I feel like a normal person. But, I can't afford that. I picked up an Avon catalog one night when I was at a Chinese buffet, and happen to see the words &#34;glycolic acid&#34;. In my mind, basically any acid to eat off my ...
I have horrible cracked/dry feet and I'm only 28! Last time I had a pedicure I was told, &#34;This is the best I can do.&#34; So disappointing. I've used this twice and the difference is night and day. No more getting my feet snagged on the sheets at night. Love it!
There are no instructions.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
A little goes a long way with this foaming cleanser which is probably why you don't get a lot in the bottle. It lathers up nicely, and comes off leaving a slight slickness on my skin like most moisturizing face or body washes. My face felt good after I used it, clean but not tight or dry.<br /><br />It is awfully pricey for what you get, so I can't tell you to rush right out and get yourself a bottle. I couldn't afford to use it all the time. I note that it comes with instructions on how to reuse the bottle, thereby cutting down on waste. Unfortunately it came wrapped in several layers of paper in a special box, so... Not quite as small a footprint ...
For the price, I have to wonder why this item is not listed under Amazon's "luxury beauty" line. Like many reviewers, I was put off by the sheer amount of packaging that came along with this item. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't tout how conscious they were of environmental issues, but I've purchased Chanel with less packing, come on!<br /><br />All of the beauty and skin care products I consume are luxury, at the moment I've been using Dr. Gross's skin care line but until I could get back to Sephora, I've been using Purity cleanser. I was hoping this product would be a suitable replacement but I'm not convinced so let me tell you about the photos.<br /><br />Each night I cleanse my ...
To me, the most important thing about caring for your face is to keep it clean with gentle but real power. I thought my face was clean until I used this product with a facial brush. My face feels good. I have another product that I use daily, but will think of alternating days once I am certain that I have no adverse reactions.

The item description is LaClaire Foaming Botanical Facial Cleanser with Enriched Antioxidant Botanicals - Nourishing pH Balanced Face Wash (50 ml/1.65 oz), Made in the USA. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I have been trying the Korean Skin system for about a month and had a Korean water-based cleanser that I used to follow my oil cleanser. I received this product as a trial, and I was amazed by the reults. The pump and foam action makes application easy, and the soap goes on smoothly and feels great. The scent is mild and pleasant, which is a real plus given that I tend to be hypersensitive to strong odors. My skin really felt clean and fresh, and I actually liked this better than some of the highly rated Korean products. I will buy this again.

VILLAGE11FACTORY Cica Cream, Centella Soothing and Repairing Cream for Dry and Irritated Skin, Moisturizer, Anti-Wrinkles, Lightweight, Relieves Irritated Skin, Fragrance Free, Dermatologically Tested, 1.69 fl oz 50ml | I have found my skin has become more sensitive in my 40s and with all the additional washing and bathing because of Covid 19. I'm new to this brand but found this Cica cream to work very well. It immediately cooled and soothed my irritated skin without any greasiness or oiliness. It was quickly absorbed into the skin. It left my skin feeling much softer, less irritated, soothed. It is something I plan to keep on hand.
SAMYANG ABOUTME Red Recipe Super Cleansing Balm 3.04 oz. (90ml) - Soft Melting Milk Texture Makeup Cleansing Balm, Mineral Contained Nourishing & Soothing Cleansing, Rose Scented | This cleanser comes in a simple, colorful, & attractive red-and-white package. It spreads well over the skin and has a light feel. A little of it really goes a long way.<br /><br /> It is easy to remove and makes one feel fresh and clean after application.<br /><br />The one drawback is that instructions are not given in English (only in Korean) so one is left unsure whether it needs rinsing or wiping it up with tissue is enough. There needs to be an English translation on the box in order to reach the international market.
AG Care Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar Leave On Mist | This AG Hair Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar is relatively expensive at $20 for a small bottle, but it is made of natural ingredients like apple cider vinegar, organic argan oil and protein from quinoa. The spray is supposed to refresh the scalp and the hair, to reduce irritation to the scalp and to help soften hair. I have been trying different scalp treatments and was eager to see how this would work. It is less of a scalp treatment and more of a hair refresher but it does add bounce and lift to my hair.
BRING GREEN Super Yulmu Pore Deep Cleansing Foam 200ml - Adlay Seed Powder and Clay Contained Exfoliating Rich Foam Cleanser, Remove Dead Skin Cells & Blackeads, Moisturizing Deep Cleanser | I use a pea-sized portion which I mix until it froths. I apply the foam to my face and let it stand briefly before rinsing it off. It leaves my skin feeling deep cleansed but not squeaky dry. I have not had any sensitivity or redness or irritation. It works well with my regular toner and serum.
Natural Jade Roller Massager & Rose Quartz Facial Roller 2pcs Gift Set | My quartz roller worked well. I washed it carefully first and then used the larger roller for my forehead, cheeks and chin. The smaller roller worked well under my eyes. I liked the feel of the rollers as they massaged my face. They did make a slight squeaky sound but they held up well. It is similar to a face massage but very easy to do while relaxing at home. At this price, it is a reasonble buy.

I bought this set so I could try the products before buying. I was particularly interested in the serum. All the samples had product in them except for the serum which was all air in the tube. How am I supposed to know if I would like to purchase the serum? I feel robbed.
Not sure if it is authentic, the products are so strong and caused burning sensation on my skin. A total waste of my money
Love all the products in here so worth every penny
First off I love Caudalie I’ve used the brand a lot having a set I can take traveling is awesome I never have to be with out my faves
Moisturizer is great should make the eye cream slightly larger but that's the only issue I see

The item description is Caudalie Favorites Set. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I love trying new skincare products and brands from overseas. I've found French skincare products to be particularly innovative and high quality even when they are not expensive. Caudalie is well known internationally and has a spa in New York City's Plaza Hotel.  It's products are among those always listed in a search of "what skincare should I buy while in Paris" or "What items should I buy at at French pharmacy?"<br /><br />This travel kit with the favorite products is a relatively inexpensive way to try a range of Caudalie skincare and their distinctive ingredients. The brand is known for their use of the grapeseeds from a vineyard and discovering the antioxidants help to combat aging and free radicals.  This kit has some of their more expensive creams in small doses, so you can try the range of creams (Vinoperfect, Premier Cru, Vinosource and the famous Beauty Elixir and Instant Foaming Cleanser.  It comes in a zippered tote perfect for traveling.  I love this set and plan to get one for my mother. While we can't travel during this covid pandemic, we can look forward to traveling together in the future. It's a gift of skincare and a promise of future adventures.

Very High Quality Curling Iron Most stores dont carry the 1 inch barrel anymore but this is the one my wife has used forever .I was told Aazon maybe my only chioce and it was.
I bought this product because I had an older model which simply died. I am disappointed in this newly increased handle diameter. Anyone who has a smaller-than-average grip circumference, or has the beginnings of arthritis, will be disappointed as well. The designers should have kept the handle circumference the same as before. Performance of the barrel and heating element are better than the oder model, however.
Just as expected.

These flexi rods are some of the poorest quality that I've used because they bed EXTRMELY easy and the inner white part comes out as if it isn't adhered to the foam. But, if you don't care about the quality and looking to save money, this is it.

Microfiber Hair Towels - 5 Towel Set – 5 Beautiful Colors - Great for all Hair Types - Size (10 x 26 inches) Lightweight, Absorbent, and Ultra Soft. Colors Rose, Pink, Gray, Blue, and Lilac. | I absolutely love these hair towels. My hair is down to the middle of my back, and they are super absorbent. When I wrap my hair in the towel soaking wet, my hair is pretty dry after about ten minutes.<br /><br />They are plenty big enough for long hair. I have no problems twisting my hair up and buttoning it. The two buttons make it even easier to button.<br /><br />I washed them in cold water in the washing machine, and dried them on low.<br /><br />After using them, I hang them up, and they dry really fast.<br /><br />The set included five towels. light blue, light purple, rose, pink and gray.<br /><br />I recommend
LANGE HAIR Extendé Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ | I've been wanting to try Lange's products for awhile now, and I just wasn't impressed with this one. I quit using my normal after shower hair product, and started using this one instead.<br /><br />First I'm not sure if it detangled my hair or not, as I have a really good brush that doesn't pull my tangles at all if I have them.<br />The smell was super strong and gave me a migraine.<br />It did not help with frizz at all.<br />It left my hair feeling dry.
Klavuu Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack- Overnight Exfoliating & Nourishing Lip Treatment Balm for Dry Lips - Natural Moisturizing Lip Oil with Vanilla Flavor - Lip Balm to Repair & Protect Lips 0.7oz. | I love the Klavuu lip treatment. It is really moisturizing. I use it before bed and multiple times a day. Love applying it over lip color. My lips are always soft after using it. The flavor is supposed to be vanilla, but I don't really smell or taste it.<br />Product is made in Korea.
Natwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set. | I've gotten several different brands and sizes of reusable makeup pads and I think the little ones work the best as far as taking makeup off goes. I don't wear makeup often, but these work great for taking waterproof eyeliner off. I just soaked the pad in hot water and then wiped my eyes and the eyeliner came right off.<br /><br />They are made of microfiber material and are super soft. They are not very thick, but they do a fantastic job. The set comes with 18. 6 pink, 6 white, and 6 blue.<br /><br />Once your done using them, you can use the laundry bag provided and toss them in the washing machine or hand wash them.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these makeup pads.
5-Pack Hair Scalp scrubber Massager Shampoo Brush for Straight Curly Long Short Thick Thin Wet Dry Hair, Men Women Kids Scalp Care Hair Cleaning Shower, Scalp Care Brush,100% comfortable | These hair scalp massager's work wonderfully for my foster kittens baths. The bristles are very soft to use on them. The size is perfect for them being so little. They easily fit in my hand.<br /><br />I gave some to my nephew that has problems getting his hair clean and they work great. He has no trouble scrubbing his scalp.<br /><br />Love the different colors.

Amazing very nice but a very little comes I was expecting more but overall really pretty
This comes in an outer product box. It is made in Korea. There’s no ingredients in English.<br /><br />The tube is really pretty! Pink and sparkly! The glitter on the cap doesn’t transfer onto your hands, so that’s great! The tube is small, but about normal size for a liquid glitter shadow like this.<br /><br />The applicator is a little doe foot. It’s easy to hold and maneuver.<br /><br />The glitter in it is great! A lot of liquid glitter shadows like this you need to layer to get a good, even amount of glitter. With this one, I did 1 swipe using the doe foot applicator on my arm and it came out with lots of glitter and was evenly spread! You can see in my ...
