PARWIN Infrared Flat Iron 1 1/4 Inch Digital Hair Straightener Iron with Ceramic Tourmaline Plate Temperature Control Hair Iron Christmas Gift Black | [[VIDEOID:e487d57bdd82c5405085efb372c8fecd]]<br />This straightener is a nice metallic black and comes with a thin storage sleeve.

2 Pack Detangling Brush for Curly Hair, Wiisdatek Black Hair Detangler, Afro Textured 3a to 4c Kinky Wavy, Detangle Easily Wet/Dry/Long Hair for Beautiful Shiny Curls (Pink, Green) | These brushes are actually like eight combs strung together. I had to set the extra piece that comes with each brush to separate the tines. It was not easy to get the bar across the "combs" but eventually I managed. There are only two places the bar should be put and that is where the holes are on the back of the "brush." I assembled these brushes on the lower holes. My biggest issue with these brushes is that there are only two holes to lock the bar in place when I prefer four holes like my Heeta detangling brush (product number B0836XT7J8 since the Amazon embedded links are not working).<br /><br />Once this is assembled, it glides through the hair and detangles. It works well on ... | 3.0
Taya Beauty Inner Core Hair Strong Anti-Breakage Shampoo & Conditioner Duo - Strengthening and Repairing Formula - Free From Sulfates and Parabens - 8 fl oz Bottles | This comes as a set and no matter what I do, the shampoo bottle will not open. This absolutely infuriates me. I was able to open the conditioner. I removed plastic seal on the top of both bottles and turned as specified on the bottle. I spent 10 minutes trying to open the shampoo. Unless I take a hammer and chisel to it or an exacto knife, I can't use the shampoo.<br /><br />The conditioner is nice and has a subtle fresh aroma but without the pair, this is zero stars to me when I cannot get to the product. | 1.0
Butt Naked Baby Organic Sunshine Lotion | Everyday Moisturizer | Lightweight, Non-Greasy | Normal-to-Dry Skin | Aloe, Shea Butter, Sunflower Oil, Calendula, White Tea, Green Tea, Rooibos Tea, Lemon Oil | 6.7 oz | Even though this is baby lotion, I got this for me. This moisturizer is lightweight, slightly creamy, absorbs rapidly, and leaves my skin moderately hydrated. Since it is lightweight, it is a perfect summer lotion. To my senses, it has a mild lemony fragrance even though that is not listed in the ingredients. This is made of all plant-based ingredients (see photo). The current price of $16 is competitive but pricey for this 6.7 ounce tube. | 4.0

Eye Diamond Smooth and Firm Eye Cream: 100% All-Natural Anti-Aging Eye Serum – Get Rid of Wrinkles – Eye Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness, Crows Feet and Fine Lines – 100% Guarantee | I love this product. I just turned 42 and started noticing some more changes in my skin texture and pore size. I've had this product for about 2 weeks and noticed a positive change in the appearance of my skin around my eyes within a week. I didn't experience any burning or stinging. I use two times/day. My skin is sensitive and I find that some products don't work the same for me as others. However, this product to works great for me. I love it! My skin looks like it did five years ago. I am going to stick with this brand for a while. I purchased it discounted to test and review | 5.0
Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C for Face - Organic Anti Aging & Anti-Wrinkle Skin Treatment - Penetrates Deeply & Activates Collagen Production for a Younger, Firmer & Brighter Complexion | Hyaluronic acid is awesome for your skin. If you don't believe me, then literally look it up. WebMD will state that it helps with joint disorders, eye surgeries, and healing wounds/burns and more.<br /><br />The big statement here really is that it's very effective for any sort of regenerative properties. The serum is a very good moisturizer, and don't let the word &#34;acid&#34; turn you off of it. It's actually found in high quantities in the skin of a baby, which everyone knows is incredibly soft.<br /><br />This product, applied to your face, will protect it from UV damage, improve elasticity, make your face feel softer, and properly moisturize it.<br /><br />I have ben using products by Derma- nu for a while and this is my second ... | 5.0
reBROW - Best Eyebrow Thickener - Eyebrow Enhancing Serum & Conditioner For Longer, Thicker & Fuller Brows. Made in Los Angeles, CA With Advanced Peptide Molecule Technology. | My mother's eye brows are thinning and this thickener was a magic!! She has naturally thin eyebrows and hasn't gotten into the whole eyebrow makeup trends, but she always wanted fuller brows for a while. She put this on her brows at night after cleansing and she could tell the difference after day 3. She has been using it for about two weeks now and her brows are fuller than ever!It looks like it will last a while, also. It's worth it for brows, unsure about lashes because she has naturally full, long lashes.I was provided this product at a reduced price to complete and post a factual review without compensation. Positive reviews are earned only through positive product attributes and performance. | 5.0
Anti Aging Skin Care Serum for Men & Women From Uptown Cosmeceuticals Offers Spin Trap® Intelligent Antioxidant, Advanced Scientific Formula Promotes Younger Looking Face, 30mL | Since I received this serum with a great discount I shared this skin care product with my friend , so she could provide her opinion.<br />She used it for several day and that's what she found out:<br />1. Nice, presentable packaging and good design.<br />2. Very pleasant scent (citrus and spring flowers kind) very fresh<br />3. Hypoallergenic (she has EXTREMELY sensitive skin)<br />4. Her husband tried it and stated that is helped him with pores<br /> I could add to that that the package arrived very fast and even the full price with the discount is acceptable compare to other serums from the mall. | 5.0

Bath & Body Works Sun-ripened Raspberry | Sun-ripened raspberries actually has a scent that smells like the fresh, dry, clean sunshine! The tangy raspberries mixed with the dry and fresh sunshine is one awesome, heavenly, clean scent.<br /><br />This product has a very unique raspberry scent because it is mixed with the dry, crisp sunny smell. It kind of reminds me of fresh laundry in the sun with raspberries.<br /><br />After cleansing with sun-ripened raspberry shower gel, the scent is strong and lingers. It is not absolutely necessary to douse with sun-ripened raspberry lotion, even though I prefer to have the lotion in addition to the already deep and strong lingering effects of the shower gel.<br /><br />The body splash is something I like to have later, after the majority of the shower gel ... | 5.0

OGANA CELL Bio Actiome Recovery Cream 50ml / 1.69oz - Mild All in One Cream, Soothing & Anti-Wrinkle, Peptides and Blackbee Extract Contained Nourishing Skin Care | I haven’t had this too long but just the week I’ve tried it I’ve noticed a difference. I have combination skin, closer to oily. Lately I’ve needed a little more moisture. This is just right. It feels like it would be great for dry skin and oily. Maybe a little too much for oily, idk. It’s not too thick. At first, when applying it, it seems thick. But it quickly absorbs. Right away actually. It doesn’t have a strong scent. My skin feels great the next day when I wake up. I usually apply it twice a day and it’s not too oily. As I learned in cosmetology school, there’s a difference in oil and moisture. This moisturizes without being oily. | 5.0
MOSTORY Glitter Crystal Liquid Eyeshadow Set - 4 Pack Pigmented Liquid Eye shadows Matte Shimmer Metallic Quick Dry Crease Resistant Long Lasting Flake-Proof Blendable Non-Greasy Eye Makeup (4 Pack) | I was skeptical a little at first of this. I’ve tried another brand of white before and it was like water. Also, I’m not good at applying liquid eyeshadow. But let me tell you, I applied this with the applicator. It’s a sponge tip like will come in lipstick or lip gloss. Then I sort of blended it in just a little with my finger. It dries on and stays the whole work night 12 hours. It’s great. It feels a little like when something liquid would dry on skin but not bad and doesn’t show wrinkles. It may be for younger people but this 50 year old loves it. You wouldn’t believe the head turns and compliments I receive. People asked what it’s called and where ... | 5.0

Senvenski Gel Nail Polish Red Rose Burgundy Purple Mauve Lavender Violets Lilac White Black Glitter Starrily Girlfriend Gift Soak Off UV LED Manicure Art Varnish Set DIY at Home 6 Colors (CS6-015) | I just started using gel nail polish and love the look.

GOMAY Hydrating Amino Acid Foaming Facial Cleanser, Daily Face Wash for Makeup Remover with Face Cleansing Brush | The cleanser feels luxurious and decadent. Most cleansers leave my face feeling dry and tight but not this one! My skin feels fresh and moisturized after use.<br /><br />Having mature skin(over 50), I find most cleansers are drying but this product truly outshines others I’ve tried. I have sensitive skin and have experienced no problems whatsoever. The brush is a little stiff but I like it. You can opt to not use the brush if you prefer.

lilah b. - Bronzed Beauty Bronzer Duo - b. sunkissed - Multipurpose Bronzer Duo to Highlight + Contour and Blend | Let me start off by saying I am fair skinned so it's hard to find a bronzer that doesn't look so harsh with my complexion. This was offered to me to try in return for an honest review. So, upon first getting this - it was relatively heavy for just a bronzer/highlight. When I got the duo out, I realized why. The packaging that the actual bronzer/highlight is in is made of some heavy glass like material. It's packaged really pretty though. There's not a lot of product that comes in the container. But, you get a beautiful golden bronzer and a peachy highlight. The bronzer actually looks very natural on my fair skin. It's not harsh or orange. It looks like a natural shadow on my ... | 4.0
Sam&Helen Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit, 5Pairs Magnetic Eyelashes And 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliners With Eyelash Applicator-No Glue Needed | This is my third set of magnetic lashes and liner (I'm obsessed and will never go back to the glue). You get 5 different kinds of lashes in this set (I personally like the third set the best). Two liners and a tool to help apply the lashes but I don't use it - it's easier to not. However, I do press my real lashes to the fake to make it more inconspicuous. My problem with this set is the liner. For one, its VERY tacky. Even after it dries. My lower lid kept sticking to my upper eyelid any time I'd blink. Secondly, the liner is watery looking when applied. Like it's transparent almost and takes a few coats to get a solid line.

Color Me Cosmetics Gel Manicure Kit with LED Lamp - DIY Gel Nail Starter Set with Prep, Base and Top Coat, 2 Gel Polish Colors & Nail Tools - Beginner Nail Kit with Everything You Need Made in USA* | I got this gel nail set on a whim.

She has much more elegant hands and long nails so hence why she was my model for trying this gel kit. The instructions are clear and explain what is used for what and how to use them in the proper steps. The instructions also come with tips which were helpful. You get a UV light, a buffer and pads, topcoat, peel off base coat, two colors, prep it and end it solution. The UV light is a plug in and not battery operated.

I wasn’t sure that would be enough for me as I have medium thickness hair that’s a couple inches past my shoulders. I definitely need at least 2 more packs to fill in the rest of my hair. If you have thinner hair, you may get away with needing less. These haven’t shed too much either. I’ve not yet applied heat to them so I can’t attest to how well they’ll hold a curl.

KATAIMUZI shaver electric Trimmer Grooming Kit Men's Electric Razor Facial Cleaning Brush Beard Trimmer | Here is a product that you charge via USB, and have enough power to shave your legs if you want. I don't have the best eyesight and when I use a razor, I often miss areas. I used this today and I had a good amount of cleaning to do on the head and brushing out the hairs. This is the most hairs I have ever been able to remove with an electric or chargeable razor. You can also wash your face with the scrubber and trim your sideburns and more. This is also waterproof. The instructions are all in Chinese, but you can see from the pictures what to do and how to lift the rotaries to brush the hairs out. | 4.0
Fountain of Truth Magic Wand Sculpting Eye Roller – Anti-Aging Eye Cream in a Skin Massager Tool –Wrinkle, Dark Circle & Puffiness Treatment – Clean, Natural & Efficacious Beauty & Skin Care Products | But once it did prime, it let enough out to work on my eyes this morning. It felt cool thanks to metal eye roller. My eyes looked better and felt moisturized for hours. | 5.0
Simply Dana Cellular De-Stressing Cream, Boost Skin's Natural Immunity - 1 oz (30g) | and am leaving it on overnight. With the other product I am wearing overnight, my face feels so dewy and so soft. I like it. | 5.0

Revitalizing N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Serum that treats Dull, Tired, Dry and Sensitive Skin from Manilla Natural Skincare | I just love the scent of this serum! Others are saying they smell vanilla but for some reason it smells like honey to me and I just love the scent. I am trying to phase out skin care that have added smells but I just could not resist this one! After applying the serum to my face and spreading it all over, it just seeps into my skin and moisturizes. It did not feel sticky or tacky at all. I really enjoyed using this serum at night before bed and letting it work its magic. Now that we are in colder weather my skin needs a thicker face cream like oils/serum so this is just perfect. I plan to use this every night because the scent just ... | 5.0
Bouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz | I know scents are a personal thing and can be a hit or miss for most people. I didn’t mind the vanilla musk scent at all and thought it was pleasant. This is a good sized bottle and should last quite a while. For anyone who does not want to use this as a shower gel you can always use it as hand soap or as a refill for your hand soap. I already have plenty of shower gels I need to use up in my own shower so I am putting this in our guest bathroom, especially since the bottle has a nice floral design. My only complaint is this is a Korean product but they should have also included a list of ingredients in English ... | 4.0
[Abib] Facial soap brick (BLUE) | This soap did a nice job of cleansing my face. The facial soap is a little more cost effective compared to getting a tube of face wash. It lathers just enough for me to wash my face. My face felt clean afterwards and did not feel super dry. I followed it up with a face moisturizer soon after. If you don’t want to use it on your face you can always use it as a body soap.<br /><br />I did not particularly like the scent of the blue one. I can’t put my finger on what it smells like. One thing that had me worried is the soap says “exp: May 24, 2021”, so I’m a little confused as to why the soap has such a short ... | 3.0
Laloirelle Deep Hydration Face Oil - Nourishing Helichrysum Oil, Avocado Oil Infused With Red Ginseng, Shitake Mushroom, Elderflower - Unparalleled For Moisturizing Very Dry, Dull or Aging Skin - 1.0 fl oz | I love face oils and never worry about them being too oily because I only use them at night before bed - that way they have time to seep into the skin and work while I sleep. I just love the smell of this one - especially when the smells are from oils / essential oils, and nothing synthetic. This bottle is just chock full of good stuff, good ingredients, and herbs and things. As we get into the winter season this will be perfect to keep my skin moisturized so at the moment I am using it sparingly. After trying this face oil I am excited to explore other products from Laloirelle because their formulation and ingredients used are exactly the type of stuff I love ... | 5.0
