Pick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material) | This pick is absolutely terrible. It is made of flexible plastic that is easily breakable and the pick ends are so thick, they are like scaled down hammer claws that do nothing to scrap the teeth. It went right in the trash. | 1.0
BLAISTER Animal Print Headbands for Women, Leopard Print Head Bands Athleisure Hair Band Non Slip Stretchy Breathable Head Wrap Elastic Hair Accessories (Leopard Print) | I thought I would love this headband. It is gorgeous and feels great but the material it is made of is so slippery that it keeps sliding off my hair. It is only for this reason I rated this 2 stars as it is not for me. | 2.0
Folie for Women EDP - Eau De Parfum 100ml(3.4 oz) | Saffron, Red Fruits, Hedione, Jasmine, Moss, Amber | Perfume, Perfumes for women, Women's fragrances, Fragrance, Womens perfume | by Intense Elite | I wish I loved this. This is a nicely packaged perfume in an attractive bottle with a gold-colored tassel hanging from the side. The scent is neither offensive nor enticing. I can't even describe what it smells like. It is so very subtle but it lasts a few hours.<br /><br />The current price of $44.99 ($49.99 minus $5) is competitively priced for perfume like this but it is not one I would order again as I have to really love it to pay that much. | 3.0
Beautiful Girl You Can Do Amazing Things, Inspirational Gifts for Women, Christmas Gifts, Amazing Gifts for Teen Girls, Beautiful Gift Makeup Bag, Inspirational Jewelry Dish, Amazing Mirror | This is a nice set.

The clasp is solid and the finish is high-gloss like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside of both sides of the mirror is inspirational. It says "Beautiful girl you can do amazing things."<br /><br />There is also a small dish for jewelry and a very cheap make-up case all with the same inspirational verse.<br /><br />In summary, this is a nice gift set. The current price of $20.89 ($21.99 minus 5%) is competitive. | 4.0

These brushes were absolutely beautiful and very soft but I did return them. Most of the brushes are the same exact size. I was looking for eyeshadow brushes more so than face brushes. I could’ve looked at the pictures a little bit closer to see that the kit only came with bigger brushes. No big deal but if you were looking for big brushes this is definitely a kit to buy! | 3.0
This is a nice set of brushes. The brush is a soft pink synthetic fiber. The handles are a pinkish crystal handle. The brushes come in a clear plastic bag that closes to store your brushes. | 5.0

Mererke_Pretty Nurtured Argan Oil (1.7oz) | My middle daughter has thicker hair, so I use this product on her. After she washes her hair she applies this serum. Her hair have 3 colors in them naturally, darker brown, lighter brown and red. When she applies this oil her classmates thought that she dyed her hair! It just bring so much shine and compliment her hair. After seeing that effect I applied it on my fine hair. I have highlights. It brings the different color in my hair as well. My co-workers thought that I just visited a hairdresser. So, I would suggest it for anyone. I do not use conditioner when I use the product. I received this serum discounted during promo period to test and review. | 5.0
Anti Aging Eye Wrinkle Cream for Women & Men with Hyaluronic Acid Matrixyl 3000 Complex to Moisturize Your Skin Day And Night – 1.8 Fl. Oz | The whole summer I was kind of slacking off on my eye cream. Now it is time to re-start on my &#34;beauty regimen&#34; again. I was pleasently surprised that the jar was a decent size, not a tiny one. Here are my pros and cons:<br />Pros:<br />1. Ingredients are natural, in harmony with my skin<br />2. Nice, light smell<br />3.Only need a small amount, so it will last long time<br />4. Decent price<br />5. Improvement in fine wrinkles around my eyes<br />Cons: none so far. If I encounter any, I will update my review. I have been using it for solid 10 days and now I am sharing the jar with my mom as well. She love it, too. May be i will get her her own ... | 5.0

1513 by LA LA LEAF - All Natural Facial Cream, 750mg Quick Absorbing Hemp Moisturizer with Rosehip, Carrot Seed and Provitamin B5 - Smooths Wrinkles for Firm Glowing Skin - Paraben-free, Cruelty-free, Vegan | I don’t think I could use it consistently on my face but, this helps my often super dry Neck to look healthier and more youthful.

Glass spray bottle-16 ounce empty bottle ounce refillable container 2 packs, suitable for essential oils, cleaning products, aromatherapy, water mist plants with mist and air flow settings | These arrived quickly and in perfect order. The sprayers work well and the set comes with 2 nice Caps to fully seal them, if needed and even a little Funnel to make a clean fill. I think they’re pretty decent and would definitely recommend. | 4.0
DeepDream Portable Electric Nail Drill - Professional Efile Nail Drill Kit For Acrylic, Gel Nails, Manicure Pedicure Polishing Shape Tools with 11Pcs Nail Drill Bits and 36 Sanding Bands | I thought it was a wireless model but, for it not being one, it’s quite a bit thinner than one with a battery in it and it’s lightweight. It’s made of metal and it comes with a decent amount of different grinding tips and sander roles. The control is simple, works well and it’s powerful enough to to a good job. I’d definitely recommend it.<br /> Stay Healthy Everyone!😁 | 5.0

This is a mediocre set. It isnt especially bad nor good. The scissor blades don't meet in the middle so they dont cut very well. One set of nail clippers has a weird angle and leaves ridges on the surface of the nail. The other does a better job but for some reason launches the pieces of nail far away - not great for keeping the house tidy. The case doesnt stay shut.<br /><br />Overall, most of the pieces work they just dont do a great job. I'd have preferred a simpler set with fewer pieces of better quality. | 3.0
This callus set is one of the best I’ve had it’s tools are sturdy n sting for when I need a little extra power it’s grinder file cuts deep in the callus without breaking skin or getting dull | 5.0
Short summary: I like a number of the instruments available in this set; they work well for my needs, and for the needs of our family members.<br />The case securely holds each instrument in its slot; but some instruments are tough to remove from their slots.<br /><br />More details:<br /><br />a) Case is soft to the touch and comfortable to hold.

I ordered a pack of 2 of a 1000 each. only got a small box of 200. missing 1800 applicators. Very upset | 1.0
I chose this product above the others because it offered 2 per pack. I need two per pack because of sterility. I received a plastic bag arrived with 20 packs of 50 applicators. The plastic bag is clearly labeled &#34;2 per pack&#34;. There are plenty of other six inch applicators that cheaper than this. I paid more because I wanted them packed in two's. I will make due and will find alternate ways to keep them sterile, but I will not purchase this again. | 2.0

Jade Roller for Face,Anti-aging Jade Roller Massager Eye Jade Facial Roller for Women Puffiness, Real Jade 100% Natural Herbivore Jade Facial Roller Jade Stone Roller Set with Gua Sha Tool,Case,Pouch | This roller feels good on the face. It is for massaging the face and blood circulation. There are instructions to tell you how to do it.<br /><br />The Jades are a very beautiful color. And the kit comes with a little bag that is a VERY beautiful shade of green. So beautiful, I wanted to eat it up. (Those of you who know me know that I am a color person). I knew that green was my second favorite color. If red/pink didn't already fill the spot of my favorite color, then this shade of green would be it. Third favorite color is a tie between purple and orange. | 5.0

I’m pretty spoiled when it comes to facial products. I would say this is fine, not great, not terrible. It is a nicely packaged one time mask for a little at home spa day, but not something I’d go out and purchase over and over. It would make a really nice stocking stuffer or small gift for someone. | 3.0
I was expecting some larger bubbles than this mask gave me. I kept it on a bit longer than the recommended 3 minutes to see if the bubbles would get any larger, but they didn't. I think it worked well, but I think that the gimmick isn't worth what you get. My face felt pretty good afterward, but it wasn't anything special. This may be cooler to a younger demographic, but I would not get this again. | 4.0
I got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter, I will update the review once she uses it if we see any irritation or issues with it. She loves these mask so I'm always trying to find some different ones we haven't tried before. | 5.0

To me this was a total waste of money. I put them on, watched a movie and by the time I went to bed they were loose and I ended up peeling them off. I really don't think they would stay on for any length of time, certainly not for an important event. Just wasn't for me | 1.0
Terrible. I buy press on nails all the time. Some are perfect and some are terrible. These onces are TERRIBLE!!! Four nails fell off the same day I put them on!! 👎👎👎 | 1.0
Hoping to ensure the nails stayed affixed as long as possible, I made sure to follow the instructions on how to apply them. Most of the nails stayed on, but within 1 day I was having to replace a few that had fallen off (3 to be precise). The good thing is there are plenty of nails in the package. When I was ready to take them off, they came off easily and didn’t damage my real nails. | 3.0

It’s a sponge tip like will come in lipstick or lip gloss. Then I sort of blended it in just a little with my finger. It dries on and stays the whole work night 12 hours. It’s great. It feels a little like when something liquid would dry on skin but not bad and doesn’t show wrinkles. It may be for younger people but this 50 year old loves it.

Beautiful lashes and great magnetic eyeliner. The eyeliner is totally waterproof and lasts all day without problems. Doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes and these lashes are lightweight and totally beautiful. I have worn them a few different times and they still look beautiful. I am able to clean them gently in makeup remover and then let them dry and I can wear the lashes over and over again. | 5.0
So overall as far as false eyelashes go, these are pretty good.<br /><br />Magnetic lashes have become sort of a craze here in the last year or so, and I can see understandably why. The key however to applying them is to make sure you have a quality magnetic liner for application, and patience.<br /><br />I'm not huge on wearing false eyelashes or makeup on a regular basis, however for things such as family photos and an occasional date night out, it can be fun to get dressed up and feel a little "extra".<br /><br />The lashes themselves are really good quality, the liquid eyeliner goes on pretty well, but my only beef is that it can be sometimes difficult to get the magnet part to stick. ... | 4.0

Polish Due nails | Stretchable Real Nail Polish Strips| Gloss Solid Color, Ombre , French, Pattern, Glitter Finish 16Pcs | Inlcudes Nail Wipe, Nail File, Instructional Brochure 16Pcs( (Modern Royalty) | I've used this kind of nail cover before when I didn't want to go through all of the gel polish process. I loved the color of these nails and how easy it was to put on my nails. The instructions says that it should last about 14 days and I think it only lasted about a week before one or two of the nails started peeling off. I'll have to remember to wear gloves with the nails when I'm cleaning in the house. I will definitely be getting these again. | 3.0
5pcs Pearl Rose Flower Hair Rope Hair Ties, SUMERSHA Elastics Rubber Bands Fashion Floral Ponytail Holders Hair Accessories for Women and Girls | While the flowers on these hair ties are beautiful, the material covered elastic was very small. I have thick hair and it was too small to put on my ponytail or even when I have my hair in crochets. I also tried to use these on my granddaughters' hair (which is also thick) but couldn't get it around their individual ponytails either. | 2.0
Toyotress Deep Twist Crochet Hair - 12 Inch 8 Packs Natural Black Ocean Wave Crochet Braids, Short Bob Water Wave Wavy Curly Synthetic Braiding Hair Extensions (12 Inch, 1B-8P) | This was great hair to use in my crochet style. It was easy to style and very easy to maintain for about 4 weeks. I loved the length and it did stretch a little longer the longer I kept it in my hair. The blended color was great and loved how it matched my skin color. | 5.0
SHUOHAN Braiding Hair Extensions for Women 24 Inch 6 Packs/Lot High Temperature Ombre Jumbo Synthetic Hair Extensions for Twist Crochet Braids Hair (24 inches, black) | I got these for one of my granddaughters who love blue. The pictures don't do justice to how pretty the color is! It was very easy to put in her hair that now I want some for myself!! The pack had more than enough to cover her whole head and lasted for almost 6 weeks when I put in braided extensions. And it didn't have a smell like some other hair can have. Really nice hair!! | 5.0

I love, love, love this hair! It’s easy to install on your self. It’s light weight and you can reuse it. I bought 2 different colors and I love both of them. It looks natural. I get a lot of compliments on it. It last a long time. A month is usually my limit. The braid pattern is key I did the individual illusion braid pattern. | 5.0

Says made in the usa on bottle - but then says product of indonesia. So it is only bottled here. Why not just say that? Why make it sound like it the whole thing was made in usa? Just be up front. I don't see why it can't be made here - but since it's not - why not advertise as a foreign product? | 1.0
The company has 'organics' in the name but the FCO doesn't actually say 'organic' anywhere on the bottle so I'm assuming it's not. It's so disappointing. | 2.0
Coconut oil is amazing! I get dry skin in the winter so I don't even use soap in the shower, but after I shower, I cover my whole body with it to keep me from itching. Having the pump is great too! The pump is a little long for the bottle, so I just trimmed it a little. I got one from another place without the pump and is difficult to apply and the bottle gets all greasy. This one is definitely better! Not to mention, this is great to use on your face and neck without clogging pores. I also use it after swimming! BTW, it is also a good lubricant for romantic nights...especially if you put some essential oils in it... bow-chick-a-wow-wow@ | 4.0

AJOKE Makeup Sponge Wedges,Latex Free Foam Beauty Sponge,for all kinds of cosmetics（20-count） | These sponges are a great addition to my makeup routine. The Texture is Smooth and Blends my Foundation well. I love the size too! They are smaller than my usual ones and are Perfect to get my Under Eye Concealer blended Evenly.<br /><br />The jar is cute and looks Great on my counter. I’m Happy I gave them a try! I hope this review helps you. | 4.0
Dudulanni 24 Pcs Press on Nails Medium, Fake Nails with Nail Glue, Stick Glue on Nails False Nails Acrylic Nails for Women S Ombre Pink Almond | I like the color but they don’t really look ombre. They are thin and fit fairly well. The length is nice and does help elongate the look of my hand.<br /><br />Overall, not the best but still nice.<br /><br />I Hope you find my Review Helpful, Thanks for Reading. | 4.0
GOMAY Hydrating Amino Acid Foaming Facial Cleanser, Daily Face Wash for Makeup Remover with Face Cleansing Brush | The cleanser feels luxurious and decadent. Most cleansers leave my face feeling dry and tight but not this one! My skin feels fresh and moisturized after use.<br /><br />Having mature skin(over 50), I find most cleansers are drying but this product truly outshines others I’ve tried. I have sensitive skin and have experienced no problems whatsoever. The brush is a little stiff but I like it. You can opt to not use the brush if you prefer. Overall I am Very Pleased with this product and def recommend it. I hope this review helps! | 5.0
IS_FROM isfrom Three Blend Oil GREENERY for Soothing 1.01oz l Vegan Facial Oil for Dry Skin | I really like this blend of oils for your face and neck. It goes on nice and smooth and leaves my skin hydrated well. I love that all the ingredients are Natural, Vegan, as well as Cruelty free, all important to me! This blended oil Smells Really Good!<br /><br />I really enjoy using products that have hemp seed oil and bergamot oil. The use of hemp seed oil in this product serves as a carrier oil as well as soothes and moisturizes your skin. Bergamot helps to calm your skin as well as acts as an anti-inflammatory agent. Holy Basil is also used in this blend of oils and helps improve your skins elasticity. All three of these ingredients work well in concert with each other.<br /><br ... | 5.0

These are very big claw clips. They are very sturdy and durable. I just didn’t like them because they are very large. | 2.0
Good assortment of different designs and colors of hair clips, especially for the price. They're exactly like the pictures and large size. They've held my hair up for entire days with no issues so far. I have wavy/curly shoulder length hair and clips are always nice to hold my hair without worrying about getting hair caught or tangled in it as I would with a hair tie. | 5.0

PHOERA 30ml Foundation Liquid Full Coverage 24HR Matte Oil Control Concealer (Nude & Buff Beige) with 6ml Makeup Face Primer & Kabuki Foundation Brush Flat Top | Coverage is okay for me. This foundation is thinner than I’m used to. I have combination skin and it’s so hard to find a decent foundation that doesn’t look cakey and doesn’t dry and flake. This duo unfortunately is no different. The primer didn’t do anything for me either. It looks fine on outside of my cheeks and some other areas of my face but as for my T zone - it just looked patchy and dry. I’m disappointed but not surprised. I feel this duo would work fine for someone who doesn’t have troublesome combination skin and little to no adult acne. Oh, and it settled into my pores and made them look worse. Not impressed. | 2.0
Keratin Secrets Keratin Infused Shampoo and Conditioner Duo 12 Ounce | I’ve heard of Keratin treatments and that its supposedly good for your hair. So, I figured I’d give this combo a try. First off, it’s hard to squeeze the shampoo out of the bottle, even more so when your hands are wet. That was frustrating. The conditioner comes in a pump and it’s much too thick for the small pump thus making it hard to get out. Thirdly, these do not smell nice. They smell very bizarre and did not like that my hair smelled like it afterwards. The results of this combo were not impressive either. Especially for $50! My $20 combo works so much better than this shampoo and conditioner. I am bummed that this was not better. I could’ve gotten past the weird smell ... | 1.0
Charyeah Bath Pillow Bathtub Spa Pillow With Powerful Gripping Suctions, Comfortable and Soft 2-Panel Cushions for Head, Neck, Back and Shoulder Support,Fits Hot Tub, Jacuzzi, Spas | So, I know this says spa pillow but I don’t have a luxurious soaking tub (yet). I just have your standard plastic tub insert. I take hot soaks 1-2x a week as a way to relax and ease my chronic aches. I got this in hopes it’d add some comfort for my back and neck during my soaks. It’s big in our tub insert but I like that. It’s comfortable and helps with my spine not hitting the cold tub. I wish it was a bit more conforming/squishy but it does work well in supporting my back and neck. The suction cups stick well to the tub and haven’t had any issues with them popping off. This is a nice tub pillow and works well for added ... | 4.0
FragrantShare Makeup Brushes Set Dark Green Foundation Concealer Eye Shadow Makeup Sets 14 Pieces [Sterile - Disinfection Treatment] | I really didn’t need new brushes but I saw this set and thought the color was beautiful and different so I had to snag it. The brushes are soft and feel well made. Not a lot of bristle fall out at all. And one of the things I love is that each brush came in it’s own sealed bag which made it feel more sanitary from the time it left the factory to when it got to me. The color and brushes are just as they look in the photos. Which is great because it’s not always accurate. They pick up pigment and shadow well and blend them beautifully. I’ve had no issues! Love this set! | 5.0

I was hoping to find something to take off my makeup easily at night for those lazy nights where I can't be bothered. Normally I have a five step routine (I know it's excessive). I have very sensitive pale skin and tried to gently wipe off my foundation to start with and felt it just tugging really hard. The fabric itself is extremely soft, like a baby blanket. I thought maybe if I wet it and tried it would help, alas my skin broke out and I had to put it down.<br /><br />The packaging is great, the seller seems like an excellent business person and really wants to take care of you as a customer. I feel bad taking off a few stars for that reason. ... | 3.0
This is the best makeup wipe I have ever had! You put it under hot water for 10 seconds and wipe your eyes and all of the makeup comes off! There is little to no residue the next day either. The cloth is so soft and washes easily as well. So much better than drippy liquids, or expensive wipes. Love it! | 5.0
I have sensitive skin and have trouble finding a makeup remover that doesn’t irritate. Someone had recommend that I start using a Wet microfiber cloth. To be honest, I had no idea these facecloths were even made so I bought a new microfiber dishcloth which worked wonders with just warm water. When I was given the opportunity to try these microfiber makeup removers, I was excited to give it a try. Just like the dishcloth, these too worked wonders. With just warm water, the microfibers whisk makeup away without smearing or leaving traces. There are two small round pads for the eye area, and a longer narrow face cloth. They all have rings to hang and dry. They wash and dry nicely without shedding. For less than ... | 5.0

NewLife Naturals Intimate Feminine Spray Combo Pack: All Natural Vaginal Sprays with Natural Oils - PH Balance - BV Symptoms - Made in USA | they are not fragrance free though. As know, essential oils have fragrances to them and you can smell the oils in these two bottles. What is bad, is that they both leaked, even though they had plastic covering the tops and on the upper parts of the bottle. They were shipped in a shipper bag with the poly bubble interior and that was not enough protection. | 3.0
Avajar Red LED Nourishing Cream 1.69 fl oz (50ml) - Face Moisturizer for Dry Skin | Retinol Cream for Face | Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer for Face | Hydrating Face Cream | Face Lotion for Women & Men | So, to try this out, I followed the directions, opened the LED part and removed the blue battery saver paper. Then I reassembled, making sure that the batteries were in the correct position. Then, I could not get the thing to turn on. I tried in different parts of my face, holding it there and nothing happened. | 2.0
MBA Renewing Retinol Serum, 1.7 fl. oz, 0.5% Retinol Hydrates & Brightens Skin's Appearance by Diminishing the Look of Breakouts, Hyperpigmentation, and Signs of Aging by Higher Education Skincare | When I opened up the box, the tube of MBA was right there. It is not a jar, but a tube that you pump the product out. The circular on the inside advises newbies to use one pump all over the face and avoiding the eyes, mouth and neck areas. You start out twice a week or every three days. After two or three weeks, the skin adjusts to the usage and you can start using more often. They also included a trial size of Double Major, which is great, since you will probably have dead skin cells start to flake off. | 5.0
LAGEE Premium Flat Ellipse Eyelash Extensions Matte Black 0.12mm D curl 13mm Mixed Faux Mink Lash Individual Classic Split Tip Professional Lashes Supplies | These are great ones to learn with. They are already just to set in place. They have adhesive already. You just pick one with the tweezers and set it where you want it on your eyelashes.

I’ve been using this product daily for about a week and a half now on my face. The main reason I wanted to try it was because of the claims that it reduces fine lines. I don’t have a lot but i do have a few small ones on my forehead. Unfortunately I haven’t noticed any difference in that.<br /><br />I haven’t noticed any difference in the appearance of my skin at all. I will say however that it is very moisturizing without feeling greasy or heavy etc. but based on the fact that that was the only benefit I saw, I probably wouldn’t purchase this again just for a moisturizer. Also the bottle expires in just two months so you’ve gotta use it up fast | 3.0
I love Easydew and have been using their cleanser, ampoule and efg cream for a while and love this cream as well but the cream I received expire in just 4 month!<br />All other easydew products I got last year(2020) won’t expire until 2023!<br />Korean skincare have 3 years expiration date since manufactured date so all other easydew products I got last year was manufactured on 2020(same year I got) and pretty fresh but this cream is expired in 4 month that means this was made back in 2018....<br />Yes, it’s not expired yet but getting 2018 products when it’s 2021 seems kind of bummer.<br />I only use this cream when my skin feel sensitive or had trouble like pimple and etc and I don’t use everyday ... | 3.0
This cream makes my skin so moisture. Definitely good for dry skin. | 5.0
Overall, this product isn’t horrible compared to others on the market. It is paraben-free, sulfate-free, EU Allergen free and uses minimal ingredients however it also contains alcohol, silicone and is not safe for fungal acne. After running this product through a cosmetic ingredient safety checker, it scored an 88% one the EWG Health Rating. Most popular, name-brand face lotions are around 65%-80% on the EWG Health Rating. I use the EWG (Environment Working Group) as a reference when checking products and try to stay away from the alarmist side. Only 8% of this product is considered “moderate risk” mainly polyarylamide, Fragrance (unnecessary additive; possible allergy) , alcohol denat.

Boiess Colognes Poppy mint For Moms, Babies & Kids | Natural Eau de Cologne | Clean & Fresh Scent | Children Fragrance For Soft & Sensitive Skin | Easy Use, Gentle on Baby | Size: 8.5 FL Oz | I was curious about a perfume for baby because we've been taught not to use anything on the little ones except the gentlest of lotions and body wash. I decided to give this a try because I was curious about the scent and the execution of a product like this.<br /><br />First thing I did was smell this, and while it is a pleasant smell, this particular scent isn't my favorite. It is too floral for me, almost artificial. I may have liked and felt more comfortable using a citrus and fruity type of scent on my little one. I also looked at the ingredients list and while they may be free of parabens, phthalates, synthetic colors, dyes, GMOs, and Gluten Free, there are some potentially irritating ... | 3.0
[Abib] Facial soap brick (BLUE) | This soap did a nice job of cleansing my face. The facial soap is a little more cost effective compared to getting a tube of face wash. It lathers just enough for me to wash my face. My face felt clean afterwards and did not feel super dry. I followed it up with a face moisturizer soon after. If you don’t want to use it on your face you can always use it as a body soap.<br /><br />I did not particularly like the scent of the blue one. I can’t put my finger on what it smells like. One thing that had me worried is the soap says “exp: May 24, 2021”, so I’m a little confused as to why the soap has such a short ... | 3.0

This week I gave these a try and really liked them. First of all, the smell was quite nice - very light but a very nice smell. I actually try to put all the serum that was stuck on the package onto the mask because I wanted more of the nice smell on my face. The mask is soaked in serum and had a little extra left which I scooped out and piled onto the mask on my face. The material of the mask is soft. After 20 minutes it was not dry yet (still damp) but I removed the mask to a very moisturized face. I was able ... | 5.0
HASK CUCUMBER + ALOE Body Wash 2 Pack- Refreshing, vegan formula, hypoallergenic, dermatologist tested, pH balanced- 2 Pack of 24.5 oz Bottles | This is a pretty good sized bottle of body wash that will last quite a while! It has.a thick, creamy consistency - not at all watered down, which I appreciate! It feels nice on the skin, lathers well, and gives me skin a good clean. I got the cucumber aloe one, it smells nice. I've seen this brand around but never tried it until now. I'm glad I did. It is a good body wash and great value, especially this two pack one.

I read that the Vitamin C serum in this pack was a terrific gem, but since I had never heard of this line I was skeptical and only purchased the mini size to try.

I have now invested in the larger size Vitamin serum and moisturizer and I love them both. I would absolutely recommend these products. | 5.0
