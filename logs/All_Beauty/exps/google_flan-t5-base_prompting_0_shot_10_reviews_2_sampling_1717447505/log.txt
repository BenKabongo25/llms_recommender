10ML Essential Oil 100% Pure Natural Undiluted Therapeutic Grade Perfect for Aromatherapy, Relaxation, Skin Therapy Cleaning (Cajeput) | Cajeput Essential Oil (EO) is great in blends for men. My men's milk shaving soap is one of my best sellers at the farmers market.<br /><br />I've been using EO's for well over a decade. I use them in my own skin care products such as lip balms & creams plus my own milk soaps, bathroom sprays, fungal salves, & even blends for treating my farm animals. I never use toxic fragrance oils or perfumes. When I switched to an organic natural lifestyle, my health improved dramatically. I highly recommend essential oils over the toxic man made crapola.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased.
10Pack 2oz Plastic Empty Spray Bottle, Mostof Fine Mist Small Clear Travel Plastic Bottles Container with Funnels Labels | These perform very well. I use them to make my own essential oil (EO) bug sprays, after sun sprays, room refreshers, etc. They are small, spray well & don't leak.<br /><br />The small size is great for portability. I take one of my bug spray formulas outside with me for while I work on my farm. Because I only use EO's the effectiveness wears off much faster than synthetic products. I keep the bottle on me to respray as needed. I have a bottle in my purse with a germ fighting blend for when stores are out of the cart wipes. I even made up a bottle of toilet spray. I use peppermint EO for that.<br /><br />The funnel has a very narrow spout making pouring a ...
CESTLV Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush + Toothpaste Kit (10 Pack Bulk), Hotel Amenities for Guest & Travel, BPA Free, Individually Boxed Dental Kits, Recyclable | I ordered these for when I have guests on my eco farm. I'm not a fan of plastic toothbrushes & have been using bamboo toothbrushes for many years now. It is interesting to see folks reaction to these types of toothbrushes. I know I've managed to convert some over to bamboo, but not everyone. The mini toothpaste is nice & minty, providing a good, refreshing cleaning.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased.
Lesentia Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 31 ‚Äì Tinted Moisturizer For Face With Spf and Blemish Concealer with All Natural Ingredients like Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and Zinc* (Medium - 2fl oz) | This is a really nice tinted moisturizer. I run my own eco farm full time & need a lot of sun protection. I always wear a wide brimmed Sloggers brand hat along with a natural tinted moisturizer with SPF.<br /><br />Lesentia with a SPF of 31, provides natural looking coverage & helps to keep my skin tone more even looking. It adds a nice warm touch of color that is perfect for summer wear. It performs exactly as described. It does leave a shine, so I touch it up with Organic Wear pressed powder. There are no weird ingredients or fragrances.<br /><br />Another natural tinted moisturizer I like is by Organic Wear. Organic Wear provides a very thin, light coverage that requires a little bit of pressed ...
Feather Headbands Hippie Dreamcatcher Head Chains Boho Tribal Feather Headpiece Peacock Feather Hair Band Hair Accessories (E) | I run my own eco farm full time. I ordered this because I thought it would work really great in some photo props & it does. The "leather" sections are synthetic but still look good. The beads are wooden. There are two dyed green pheasant feathers & some really excellent quality rooster saddle feathers. The two silver beads that you use to adjust the size of the headpiece are plastic. The dream catcher section feels like cotton, it is a pretty blue color that compliments the peacock feather perfectly.<br /><br />It's very earthy & very natural, just what this dirt loving tree hugger farm girl loves.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased.
Girzzur fashion headbands for women-(6 Pack) yoga running headbands for women nonslip of wide boho Face washing makeup cloth hair bands | I ordered these because the similar hair bands I bought from Walmart were pretty well worn. These appeared to function pretty much the same way, so I went ahead & ordered them. While I do like them & they will work for my purposes, they are not as wide as they appear in the product photos (my Walmart ones are double the width). I took off a star for that & only that. Otherwise they are great. I love the variety of prints, they are comfortable, & look good.<br />If it helps, I have long straight hair that goes past my bra line. I don't have bangs. I work outdoors everyday for my full time job which is running my eco family farm. Keeping my hair out ...
Eye Mask Natural Mulberry 100% Silk Super Smooth Sleep Eye Mask for Eye Mask for Puffy Eyes for Dry Eyes for Dark Circles Sleeping Travel While Camping Multi Purpose Men and Women Eye Mask | This sleep mask is wonderful. It's thin, soft & made of real silk. The elastic band is comfortable & adjustable. I've gone through so many sleep masks since my fav from the natural food store (made of silk, cotton & filled with lavender, but thin, not puffy) finally gave up the ghost. If this had lavender buds in in... OMG, it would be perfection. Anyway, this is the closest I've found to that old mask & I absolutely love it.
Juice Organics Lip Amplifier - 0.5 oz. | I am really big on Organic & safe products. I was very excited about this lip amplifier having given up on them when I discovered how toxic they were. Sadly this product turned out to be a big disappointment & I will not purchase again.<br /><br />The only thing to like about this product is it's good safety rating in the EWG Cosmetics Database & it provides a nice shine. That's where it ends.<br /><br />It smells unpleasant. It is very very watery & thin. It says to apply generously. If you try to do that it will be all over your face. It does not last long & it is not moisturizing. It does not plump the lips(I have yet to find a product that does) ...

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
WOW! I was so surprised when I took these out of the package. They are very sturdy and look amazing. I wasn't expecting them to be as heavy as they were, but they really are pieces of art. There were a few loose hairs, but once those fell out (as most brushes do), they worked great. The carrying case they came with was also very cute. These are perfect for any Harry Potter fan. I am still so happy with how great these are.
If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will love these. I am into makeup and Harry Potter, but these are definitely more so a collectors item than brushes I will actually use. They are super, super small. These are much smaller than I was expecting both in the wand and also in the brush itself. I am ok with this as I did not plan to use these for makeup but it is worth mentioning in case you did plan to use them that way.
These are SO CUTE! I love them so much! üòç
So my boyfriend suprised me with these harry potter brushes and stitch brushes and i was so excited, i posted a photo in a group on Facebook. It was an instant hint with almost 100 ladies asking me where they can purchase. I was so impressed with the quality that i had shared this link. I am super impressed and just plain obsessed with these brushes. My boyfriend did very good and i will definitely be getting more ‚ô°

Seriously, I'm in love with these brushes!! so well made, absolutely beautiful, i highly recommend them!

Target: Here is one of those items that I didn't know I needed until I saw it. Harry Potter eye/lip makeup brushes? Sign me up! I ordered these in New-Bronze. These brushes are so well made I'm really impressed. The handles should last forever. They have a decent amount of heft to them. Obviously the brushes wont last as long, but right now, I'm not using them, LOL! I just wanted them, because you know, Harry Potter & therefore I had to have them. Impulse ordering at it's finest/worst? They even come with a velour drawstring pouch with the Storybook Cosmetics logo. If you are thinking about getting these as a gift for a HP fan, yes, get them.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased.

Royal Locks Curl Rescue Leave in Conditioner | Curly Hair Therapy | Keravis Ultra Conditioning Formula | 4 Oz | From my daughter: I like that you can use this product in a variety of ways, when hair is wet as a leave in conditioner, when hair is dry to protect it from heat styling or after it is styled to add shine. I put some on my hair after I straightened it and it seemed to work well to tame frizz and add shine. It has a light scent that isn't overpowering.
Hair Straightener, Flat Iron for Hair Styling, 2 in 1 Hair Curling and Straightening Tool, Non-Damage Floating Ceramic Plates, Adjustable Temperature 300¬∞F-450¬∞F for All Hair Types and Lengths | This flat iron works well to straighten hair, but I couldn't get it to curl very well like other straighteners I have. It is easy to use and the red light on the dial turns green when it is ready which is nice.
Manicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and"Catcher" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack) | Clippers work well. I prefer to use them without the plastic catcher that is attached, but it easily comes off. Nice travel case that includes a nail file. Clippers are very sharp and cut efficiently and smoothly.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]]. I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like ...
The Removable/detachable Water Tank is not removable nor detachable. I studied the user manual and no mention on how to remove it so you can clean it.<br /><br />It doesn't come with an adapter so unless you have an extra you will be charging with your laptop. FYI will not operate while charging.<br /><br />The full water tank lasts for 50 seconds of continuous flossing.<br /><br />A Full battery will last 30 minutes before needing a recharge. Charging time:4-6 Hours. Charging voltage:5V.<br />Cleaning modes are gentle/standard/pulse massage. High pressure water pulse, 20-140PSI water pressure. ** Make sure to not lose the little white tab that covers the charger port - you'll need it to keep it waterproof.
For a few years now my dentist has been telling me that I should get a "water pick", she said that it's more effective than flossing alone, and will help reduce the plaque build up between visits. I've meant to pick one up for awhile, and when I saw this cordless water flosser, I jumped at it.<br /><br />It does take a little while to get a hang of, for the first few times, I sprayed my face and the mirror, and everything else in the vicinity of my sink. But once I got the hang of it, I could feel the results immediately.
While this is a bit bulky to travel with, the USB charging is very convenient (It's a dedicated dongle however). The power is not as much as a corded water flosser, but a lot of times you really don't need that much power to get the job done.<br /><br />I think the best thing about this is that our middle schooler, who has braces, can take this along and clear her braces at school or when at a friends house.
I am one of those who prefer water flossers to string-based flossing. Process is much cleaner and, in my view, cleaning is more thorough.<br />This Chinese designed and made unit works well. You fill it with warm water, select the mode, possibly select a specific pick - but I always use the regular one - and you start flossing away.<br />Item design and ergonomics are generally Okay. However, the manual is not exactly helpful but most of us should be able to figure it out, eventually. Charging is via a custom USB cable but there is no actual charging unit so you need to find one such as your phone charger. You only need to charge it once every couple of weeks if you use it once ...
I quickly received my package. It didn't disappoint me. It works well, the perfect product.

Target: This is a nice cordless, travel size waterpik. It has good power for not being a regular waterpik. Some other cordless ones I‚Äôve tried haven‚Äôt had the same power. This comes with a variety of tips. Is easy to fill and use. Has different settings and power levels. Charges via a usb cable.

Love them!
These are certainly pretty, the colors are a great selection for any age...but I will not be wearing them as they are a bit too snug for me and at the ends and they have only used some kind of sticky fabric to cover the metal tips. I do not think they will stick there for long with putting on and off of your head. But for 8 pieces at just under 17.00 you probably could find a way to cover those tips if you were so inclined and they fit your head comfortably.
Pictures do not do these headbands justice. There was another reviewer who said how nice they looked - like Swarovski crystals - more high end. Her description was great and her photos were good - but the photos are nothing like the actual headbands. They look soooooo much better in person. They really do look like lovely high end bands. I was surprised how nice they look on - in real life. In the box - you are like - they are OK. But once on - WOW!<br /><br />Now they do not grip the head or hair really - sort of loose on top of my head but they are secure on the sides. I didn't feel like they were coming out or anything. They are ...
With that being said, they are great otherwise! They feel good and me or my 8 yr old daughter can wear them. Love how there's so many colors and good colors. One or any outfit we have!
Not very comfortable and some of them came falling apart. Pretty rhinestones but I‚Äôm not sure how long they can be worn for without having to take them off.
Pretty good for the price!
These are fun and cute I love how sparkly the beads are! If your looking for something to hold your hair tight back these aren‚Äôt it. They are pretty loose and have no comb- which is good if your looking for something that doesn‚Äôt squeeze your head. I wish they were a little tighter I feel like I‚Äôll have to readjust it a bit during a full day of wearing. I love that they will add a little pizzazz to my hair!
A little big for my infant daughter but I love them for myself
Honestly, when I first took these out of the package I thought they were truly hideous! But on, they are more subtle than they appeared and are quite nice for a super "girly" look. But the size is a bit weird. They are both too big and too small for my head - they are just long enough to reach my ears (and I'm only five feet tall) but they are a bit too wide. I find them uncomfortable. I also wear glasses and they just don't feel good with them, but I generally do find that with hard headbands, so that's just me.<br /><br />Maybe they'll fit a girl better even though I am the size of a small twelve-year-old! I wish I had a kid ...
I love to wear headbands to jazz up my zoom meetings. However, they usually hurt my head. I wore these all day with no issues which is insane. I found t get a picture to give these headbands justice. They are very simple with just a little shine and I think are so very cute. The value is great as well since you get so many for the low price. Definitely recommend. The colors are gorgeous.

Cuckoo Eyelashes 100% handmade 3D Faux Mink Lashes 4 Pairs/set ‚Ä¶ (Cuckoo 309) | (307) These lases are a little more dense so they definitely give the look of wearing false lashes, in kind of a more dated kind of way. I feel like the more spread out and whispy lashes are a lot more trendy these days. Band is quite thick also. Besides the band, the lashes themselves are pretty good quality and don't have a plastic sheen to them which is great. Price and quality is comparable to drugstore.<br /><br />(309) Also have a thicker band but are much more Whispy and have that fluffy instagram lash to them. Very pretty!

I apply it straight on my face, rub it in a bit, then add a bit of water to my hands, lather, then rub again. Then rinse k<br /><br />I have combo skin with drier cheeks and this doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. Still feels moisturized.<br /><br />This product smells of roses pretty strongly but I actually love the way it smells so I don't mind at all.<br /><br />Wouldn't really recommend for eye makeup though, I did find it to sting ...
[moonshot] Cream Paint Lightfit Air 3g - Blackpink Lisa Makeup Kpop Kbeauty Cosmetics, Airy Velvet Texture Matte Lip Makeup, Long Lasting Natrual Daily Lip Color (501 Almond Rose) | A pretty MLBB velvety lip color. The formula isn't nearly as drying as typical matte liquid lips. More of a velvety mousse like texture.<br /><br />I have medium tan skin and I'd say this is a nude pink shade on me so it may be a bit light for deeper skin tones.<br /><br />I discovered you can also use this as a cheek color as well! I dab a bit on the back of my hand and apply it from there. It's pretty pigmented on the cheeks so starting with less is better.
JPNK 10PCS Makeup tool set, Blender Sponges& Air cushion puff&Sponge Holder for Blending Liquid, Cream or Flawless Powder Cosmetics | You never know what you're gonna get with some of these beauty sponges, but this is definitely one of the good sets.<br /><br />The sponges are actually soft and don't absorb as much product as other sponges. I recently tried another brand that looked exactly the same but they were so hard and rubbery. These are soooo much softer in comparison. I don't feel like I'm softly punching my face like I do with the othersüòÇ<br /><br />Very easy to clean, after use and have no weird smell or anything. I haven't used the puffs or brush yet but I'm going to attempt to use the puffs for powder or maybe even jelly products. The brush would probably work well for concealer or eyeshadow primer. It has ...
Remy Human Hair Pieces Front Clip in Hair #1B Natural Black Fringe Hair Extensions with Hair Temples | I think this might work for people with smaller heads or smaller faces but I felt it wasn‚Äôt wider enough or thick enough to look good on me. The hair was very soft and real looking though!

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
This kit is fantastic. It comes with everything you need to get your nails done with a gel manicure. It has step by step instructions that are easy to follow and you end up with great looking nails. It actually doesn't take too long either since you can cure 4 nails at a time in the UV lamp except the thumps. So far I have only used the gray and really like that color a lot.<br /><br />Now what I really wish is that they have an adjunt kit where you can order more colors to go with the kit to mix it up some. Just having pink and gray is not enough in my eyes and let's face it having more options would be great where ...
I like this product because I was able to peel off the polish with ease and no damage to my nails. The kit has everything you need. The polish lasted two weeks. The instructions are simple. I am very happy with this manicure kit. I highly recommend this product.
I love the simplicity of this product. It seems to hold up fairly well on my toes have not tried on fingernails yet just toenails.colors are amazing.
I mean, you aren't starting with tons of colors or anything, but when you are new to gel nail polish, keeping it simple is the best way to begin the process. The two colors are nice, but I am sure once a person starts gel polish, they will love it and buy a set of colors that suit them. Now, the only thing I would change about this set is the UV light as it is very small. I already had a larger one and am comfortable using my big one as I can fit all four fingers under it with ease. Not that I have fat fingers or anything, but I just feel the included UV light is a tad smaller than most women would like. ...
I love this home manicure kit. It comes complete with everything you need including 2 nail polishes, prep, topcoat and UV light.<br />It was very simple to use and took me only 30 minutes to polish my nails with 2 coats of polish, clear topcoat and dried to a beautiful shine.<br />I have gotten so many compliments on how beautiful my nails look.<br />After 2 1/2 weeks I was able to peel off the polish with ease and no damage to my nails.<br />I highly recommend this product<br />Much easier then going to nail Salon and soaking off gel polish, ???
[[VIDEOID:70ce7fc92697c9cd48df225b19820b82]] My nails were in dire need of a manicure after 40 days in quarantine, and the salon I usually go to was closed due to the pandemic. I was looking online for a gel manicure kit and saw that AOC posted about this one in her Instagram story, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Pros: It is so easy to use! It came out to under $45 with tax and free shipping, which is around the amount I pay for one trip to the salon--plus it came with two free nail colors (a light pink, which shows up as a dusty rose on me, and a cool gray). I already ordered 3 more colors!<br /><br />Cons: The smell of everything is very strong, ...
Absolutely love this! It‚Äôs so easy and so quick to do!!! I haven‚Äôt found one color that I don‚Äôt like! So far I love them all!! I also love how it doesn‚Äôt damage my nails when I peel them off!!!!!
I‚Äôve been using this nail product for over a year and absolutely love it. Easy to apply and it looks like I just came from the salon. Give it a try you will not be disappointed
It is super easy to do and fun. You will be amazed at how your nails look and feel. It's better than going to the salon and paying the price for gel nails.
The starter kit is the perfect way to do your own gel manicure! The steps are easy to follow and it takes >30 minutes - AT HOME! The polish colors are very opaque and don‚Äôt leave your nails feeling weak or thin. Easy application and even easier to remove - they really do peel off. With this you can change your polish as frequently as you want. Can‚Äôt wait to get more colors and to keep saving money by doing my nails at home!

Target: The polishes in this set work wonderfully and the packaging is very nice and would make an excellent gift! Unfortunately I bumped the lamp off my table and it fell about 3 feet and stopped working...I didn't think it was much of a fall so I was pretty surprised it didn't turn on anymore.<br /><br />The lamp was compact and easy to use, fit one hand at a time. Fortunately I have another lamp but pretty bummed this one broke so easily.:/

Output: sloppy and sloppy.

Electronic Breath Spray for Bad Breath, Dry Mouth Spray, Heavy Super Mint Flavor Rechargeable Oral Care Mist, Oral Care Mouth Freshener | Impressive effectiveness from a simple vapor stream. Provides a strong mint blast and sweet mint flavor. Helps ice down a scratchy throat too. A bit pricey but a pretty neat device. Refills are pricey too.
Organic Patchouli Beard Wash by American Shaving Co, Rich, Foaming Cleanser that Softens, cleanse & Strengthens the beard hair, Clean and Refresh your beard with Patchouli Fragrance - 8 oz | Not bad...Large size, pumps a thick tan cream. Fair amount of sud/foam. Pretty strong, classic, patchouli scent. Scent washes out a bit with the soap but leaves a nice, light amount behind. Does a good job at cleansing and softening.
10 Magnets Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner, LANKIZ Exclusive 3x Stronger 1mm Ultra-Light Magnets, 5D Magnetic Lashes Pack Natural Look with 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliner Kit & Unique Applicator Tool | My wife is pretty happy with these. Nice aesthetics, decent magnets...Trick is to find the right amount of liner, it requires a good amount for a strong cling but not a crazy amount.
Somaluxe Collagen Moisturizer with 3 Types of Collagen Peptides and Hyaluronic Acid, 2 oz | The cream is fairly thin, with a pudding like consistency. Applies and spreads well. Leave a hydrated feel without an oily or shiny residual. Happy with it's performance, just not crazy about the scent. Smells earthy, like peat moss.
Dog Paw Washer Automatic Cleaner for Small and Medium dogs with Brush Pet Foot Cup Silicone | [[VIDEOID:5d66b612355cbdece6627644534d9174]] The biggest downside to this cleaner is it's price. Price is subjective, but you don't feel like you are getting a $50 product. The logo is just a crappy sticker, it feels pretty thin, isn't very powerful and didn't come with a wall plug (only cord, not a huge deal but for the price...). There are similar ones for less.<br /><br />Performance wish, I like it a lot. Coming from a manual one, this makes for much easier work to wrangle my dog an let this do the work. It is not very powerful but that is okay as it doesn't scare my dogs. This is a 4 star product but I feel I had to remove another star for it's price/value.
Automatic Hand Soap/Sanitizer Dispenser Kit - Table liquid Dispenser Pump Station 13.5 oz. Alcohol-Based Sprayer | **update** Unit stopped working after a few days. New (and tested) batteries placed in it and it won't power on. The second part, which is my original review stands true...However, I can not longer give a good rating to a product that lasted a couple days. Your results may vary.<br /><br />Nice little dispenser. Good goldielocks size, not too big, not too small. Doesn't get in the way but doesn't get overlooked. Sanitary design and functions well.
3 Barrel Curling Iron, 25mm Curling Waver Iron Hair Waver with LCD Display Adjustable Temperature 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Triple Hair Crimper Hair Tools for Deep Waves All Style (1#) | Really nice iron! 5 stars based off of it's value at a $35 price point. Is it a top of the line, 5 star iron? No...But for this price, it is an excellent value for an entry level device. The handle is very ergonomic with an on/off button with +/- temperature control. It heats up quick enough, giving you a temp readout on the LCD display. The iron itself is a little thin and somewhat cheaply painted but it functions nicely. The clasp opens and closes with ease but has good retention. My wife was unsure if she'd like one of these and she is very happy with it and it's results!
NAILGIL Poly Nail Gel (Temperature) | Nice set for the money. Packaged nicely to make for a great gift. Colors are on point and so far they are holding up will on my wife, who is a nurse and bangs her hands around all day.
SUPRENT Razors for Men with Matrix Cutter Head, 38.5¬∞ Golden Angle Shaving Kit for Men, Travelling Razor Kit-1 Mens Razor Handle, 2 Blade Refills,1 Dock,1 Shave Foam | This is a tough one to review...Works great on my neck and face but not so great on my bald head. The ergonomics are fantastic, it's a hefty metal body with nice curves. The blade nestles in the top groove with metal surrounding it...This makes for a difficult close shave from my bald head curves, I like to press down harder and get a close shave but the surrounding metal prevents that from happening. However, on my neck and cheeks, it does well, particularly with a dry shave.<br /><br />The foam is nice but nothing special. Doesn't slick up great but has a nice scent. The holder is okay...Sturdy but holds the blade loosely. Also, as of now, I don't see where I can get replacement blades.
AZURE Hyaluronic & Retinol Anti Aging Under Eye Pads- Moisturizing & Rejuvenating Eye Mask Patches - Reduces Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Dark Circles & Puffiness - Skin Care Made in Korea - 5 Pairs | Pretty straight forward. Come 2 to a sealed pouch. They are stacked in the pouch so they can be a little difficult to get apart and straightened out. No noticeable or standout scent to them. Apply smooth, nice that they have slits so you can shape it to your contour. They do a nice job refreshing and smoothing my eyes.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
This everything wash has such an amazing fragrance. I've been trying to think about how to describe it but it is more complex than most body wash scents. It has notes that are fresh and crisp and others that are spicy and warm... it's a great unisex choice. It lathers very well. The consistency is good, not too thick or thin, and is a translucent pearly white. As a body wash it is perfect. As a shampoo it does leave my normal-dry hair feeling drier than my moisturizing shampoo. I followed it up with a leave in conditioner/detangler and my hair dried it's normal texture and shine. The pump dispenser will twist to lock. I wish I had it for my last vacation where we drove and ...
This is a gentle wash. It is mild and has very mild scent. It doesn't dry out the skin and keeps it moisturized. It also feels fresh after using this.
I‚Äôm obsessed with the scent of this 3-in-1 product. It smells great! It produces a very soft-feeling foam and a little goes a long way. I think this has become one of my must-have bath products.
I honestly did not expect this combination bodywash, soap and shampoo to work so well.<br />Yes, it makes a good body wash with its clove, cedarwood and sandalwood scent. Its smells woody and exotic and leaves my skin gently clean. As a shampoo, it works equally well, and more importantly left my hair in great shape. I tried it without using a conditioner or oil afterwards expecting my usual dry frizz. Much to my surprise my hair looks silky and shiny. Loving this.
Came exactly as packaged, nice pump on the bottle and it looks premium. It worked well as a hand soap and body soap but the scent is very strong for me and stays for a pretty long time (1-3 hours?). I might use it as hand soap but the strong scent on this isn't for me.<br /><br />The sandalwood scent is more overpowering on this than mint.<br /><br />If you want something scented this one's it as it lasts pretty long for a soap/wash.

Target: Pumps out thick and hand soap like... Works to a nice lather. Scent is wonderful potpourri apple spice! Cinnamon, nutmeg, sandalwood forward with a soft fruit background. Goes on gel like, washes off fairly easy. End result is a bit on the dry side but the trade off is very soft and clean feeling skin/hair.

Output: Great iron!

[the SAEM] Derma Plan Cleansing Bubble Pad 15pcs - One Step Gentle Makeup Cleansing Wipes Produce Fine & Dense Bubbles, Hypoallergenic Formula, Pore Clean, Mild Exfoliation | I was so happy when I saw these little cleansing pads on Amazon! I was a HUGE fan of the just-add-water cleaning pads that used to be on the market several years ago (not sure if it was Ponds or Oil of Olay that made them), but then those stopped being sold. They were the best for traveling since they were dry until you planned to use them. Like these pads from the SAEM, you never had to worry about leakage in your bag, TSA pulling them, or the pads drying out. Just like those old cleansing pads, these also have a smooth side for cleansing and a textured side for exfoliating. Unlike those other pads, these have a nifty little pocket to slide over your fingers.<br ...
Folora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Blue-2 | This is a nice assortment of headbands for adding some pizzaz to your hair, but they are kind of frustrating when it comes to keeping your hair held back because the inside of the band is soft rather than having the little 'teeth' that help hold your hair in place. Unless you use bobby pins underneath to hold your hair back and use these headbands to cover up the pins, you will be constantly pulling this band off and sliding it back in place to rescuer your hair due to hair coming loose. Not having the teeth makes these comfortable to wear, which makes these good for little ones who aren't fans of any pokey edges on their hair accessories. The bands are pretty thin, just fabric ...
10Pcs Foldable Duo Angled Eyebrow Brush and Spoolie Brush Mascara Applicator Eyelash Separator Eyebrow Grooming Brush Tool | These turned out to be really well made little eyelash/eyebrow spoolies! The brush side has soft bristles that are cut evenly and are securely attached to the base so there's been no bristle fallout anytime I use them. The spoolie side has a thick brush that works great to catch clumps and separate lashes. Both ends are easy to use, easy to clean, and the tool folds up for easy storage. One thing I didn't overly like about this tool is how super lightweight it is - like 'light as a feather' light. Part of that is due to it only being just over four inches long, but from looking at the picture on the listing I expected these to weigh a bit more. Another dislike is ...
SALOCY Facial Mask Applicator,Facial Mask Brush 4 Piese with 2 Piese Cat ear Headbands | Love the headbands, the brushes are pretty good. I took a pair of pliers and crimped down the metal onto the bristles so it held them better as I don't know how long the glue holding the bristles in will last after repeated washings. The handles are smooth and splinter free. The brush bristles are soft and won't scratch your skin, and smoothly applies masks from clay to gel. The bristles wash clean easily and haven't stained or changed color. The headbands are soft, totally adorable, and stay put. They wash well, but I've never put mine in the dryer and instead hang them up to air dry.

[[VIDEOID:c8dcca5d7a420562a94ee70b3fb59822]] These are the perfect tool for any nail design!<br />You get 4 tools with each having different size dotters as well as different size brushes for painting details, lines or designs! The handles have different colored loose stones inside a clear handle (pink, black, purple and aqua blue). These are easy to use and easy to clean! I love how you get different sizes conveniently having the dot tool and the line brush all on one tool (you get 4 instruments but 8 tools since brush and dotter are on 1)<br /><br />I rate this product an A+
The brushes are 5 1/2" long 1/4" wide and easy hold for articulating designs.<br />The 5 different brushes allow for various strokes of width / depth.<br /><br />The metal ends each have a different ball size tip<br />Perfect selection for large variety of designs.<br /><br />Very attractive rhinestones centers of pens.<br />5 stars
I selected this set of dual-ended brushes/dotters to use with my resin art. So far, these have been excellent for adding fine detail to my pieces (I use acrylic paint). I imagine anyone using these on their nails would have great success too. I couldn't be happier with my selection.
They work. Wife got these to experiment with designs when she does her nails. So far she is happy with them. She loves the colors and the fine tip for detailed styling. They are firm to hold and have a good grip. Does not smear the paint on the nails.
I use nail tools for my kindness rock painting. I was interested in these because they don't just have the dotting stylus on both ends like my other set. I liked the idea of the fine lines I could paint with the brush end. They are also cute and sparkly so that is a bonus. You don't get any instructions but there is always the internet. I found the brush bristles to be a little longer than a normal paint brush length so they were harder to use until I got used to them. I bet that length is handier for nails. I like these overall. They are priced well.

The item description is 5pcs Nail Art Liner Brushes, Lystaii Dual-ended Painting Nail Design Brush Pen Include Liner Brushes and Dotting Pen Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Brush Double Ended Dotting Tools Set 5,7,9,11,14mm. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I am truly surprised by how great the brush end is of these nail tools. My prior set of nail art tools had brushes as well, but the tips were definitely NOT as precise as these. The quality of these brushes is definitely comparable to some of my more expensive art brushes I use for minuscule detail work. Even after cleaning, the bristles haven't frayed or bent and the points are still precise. I paint ceramic houses and people each year for my mom to add to the Christmas village I started for her some 30 years ago, and I plan to buy another set or two of these nail art brushes to use instead of my regular paint brushes because these work so much better. They are also a fraction of the cost for art brushes with such tiny tips. The only fault I have with these tools is that the brush end is not glued on. If you pull on the metal portion, it comes right off. They aren't so loose that they fall off on their own, but I did glue them on to keep the brushes securely in place. The ends with the little ball tips don't have this problem and are securely attached to the plastic shaft. I highly recommend these brushes not only for nail art, but for any art or painted craft projects you may have planned. Even with the loose brush caps, I have to give these five stars.

Mirror Flower Nail Clippers Set 2Pcs, No Splash Nail Clippers for Fingernail and Toenail, Medical Grade Stainless Steel, Sharp Stainless Steel Flat/Oblique Nail Clipper, Trimmer Set for Men and Women | We needed to replace our worn out nail clippers and these have been a good choice. Made of stainless steel they're lightweight yet strong and open and close smoothly. The blades are sharp enough for even clean cuts and the angled pair are perfect for pesky hang nails. The nail clipping slots are something I've never encountered before but its a rather ingenious idea!<br /><br />Thanks for reading this review and I hope its helpful
FOAMIST Thickening Caffeine 3 Peptides Complex Hair Conditioner for hair loss, thin hair 250ml / 8.4 fl.oz. | I'm on the fence regarding the merits of this conditioner. I have aging [I'm 74] thin baby fine color treated hair with only normal seasonal hair loss. On the first try, I washed my hair using my normal shampoo and applied the conditioner following the directions, leaving it on 3 mins then rinsing it out. After one use, I'm not overly impressed with its ability to add thickness to my strands but it did leave my hair soft and didn't weigh it down.<br /><br />Its a thick cream with a pleasant odor and on short hair [pixie] a little goes a long way. I plan on using it over the next few weeks hoping eventually it will thicken and volumize my thin hair and encourage growth. If ...
4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Natural Waterproof Mascara Extra Long Lash,Thick Thickening and Lengthening, No Clumping, No Smudging, Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Mascara | First off I wear contact lens and so far I've had no adverse reaction. I've only tried it once and it stayed put for 24 hrs, even though a shower! Now that's what I call really waterproof! I don't normally sleep in makeup of any kind but wanted to give it an "all night" durability test. Woke up the next morning....was still there! Expected at least some "mascara" marks on my pillowcase but there was nary a mark. But my biggest surprise came when I awoke without "racoon eyes"!!! I usually wear "tubing" mascaras as other formulas end up under my eyes within a few hours, I actually expected this mascara to do the same.<br /><br />Volume and length? It definitely added length. I use Latisse so ...
R-NEU 200 Cotton Rounds, 100% Natural Turkish Cotton Makeup Remover and Facial Cleansing Cotton Round Pads, Waffle Textured Hypoallergenic Cotton Wipes, 2.25 Inch Diameter (200 Pack) | Swisspers is my usual brand but for some strange reason I decided to give these a try. They're "ok" ...they are soft and absorbent but they tend to shed fibers even when wet. As I use these around my eye area that is not a good thing! Will return to my usual rounds.
FERYES Makeup Sponge Holder with Makeup Sponge‚Äì Eco-Friendly Silicone Beauty Make Up Blender Case and Dry & Wet Use Foundation Sponge for Travel - Khaki (MS Khaki) | Wish I'd thought of this! Whenever I travel I use to keep my sponge in a zip lock bag for obvious reasons. Although it never got moldy that was my fear, this holder is a god send to anyone who travels. But of course its also great for at home storage. Super soft and easy to pop your sponge in and out. Great idea and wonderful gift, recommend
By Terry Hyaluronic Pressed Hydra-Powder | Transcluscent | Infused with Hyaluronic Acid | Vegan | OMG am I glad I tried this powder. I'm 70 and my once oily skin is now normal so the addition of HA prompted me to give it a try. Its so finely milled that it goes on light as air and disappears into your foundation. I only use a tiny amount of powder on my T-zone, but with slightly oily eyelids, shadow tends to crease even with primer so I tried it on my lids. After my eye cream and primer, I dusted it lightly over my crease area and applied shadow. My shadow stayed put with O creasing! And, unlike other powders I've tried on my lids, this one didn't enhance my slightly crinkly lids! This one is worth the $$.
EASYDEW Fill Up Volume Spot 0.67 fl oz -Anti-Aging Filler Spot Good for Topical Wrinkle Care with Hyaluronic Acid I Moisturizer with Instant Filling Effect and Skin Renewal | For Topical Area | I just started using this filler and at this time I don't feel its had the appropriate time for me to see any change in the depth of my fine lines. So this will be a 1st impression review that I will revisit after I've used this for a few weeks.<br /><br />[From the box/packaging] This product is made by the Korean, Daewoong Pharmaceutical [DN Co.] Company which according to the company's website is a global healthcare company that strives to contribute to the beauty molding industry in Korea and around the world.<br /><br />The gel has an easy to use unique packaging that doses out just the right amount needed to pat over wrinkles and fine lines.

TIANG Facial Steamer, Nano Ionic Mist Face Steamer, Hydrating Mist Sprayer Water Oxygen Injection, Nano Steamer Portable Mist Humidifier, for Face Mini Spa Rejuvenation, Moisturizing Refreshing | My first thought was that this was another gimmick but being a skincare junkie had to try it. I'm so glad that I did as it exceeded my expectations to the point that I've overlooked a few things I'd normally dock it on.<br /><br />First use: My usual routine is to wash my makeup off and immediately apply HA [Hyaluronic acid] to relieve the resulting dry tight feeling. I filled this sprayer with HA serum and at first, didn't feel anything but cool air hitting my face and wondered if any serum was even coming out. Then suddenly the tightness was gone and my face felt like it was covered with a moisture mask. When applying HA with my fingers it always took a minute or two ...
8 Rolls White Eyelash Extension PE Tape, Adhesive Fabric Eyelash Tape, Lash PE Tape for Eyelash Extension Supply, 1/2'' x 10 Yards | Although this tape is designed for eyelash extensions, I wanted to see how it worked when applying eye-shadow. I use the makeup artist's Scotch tape trick for applying eye shadow [see Dominique Sachse's, Caught on Tape U tube video] and love the effect. However, Scotch tape doesn't stick to skin evenly/smoothly leaving gaps and when its peeled off it takes some foundation with it. I was hoping this would work better and I've not been disappointed. It's easy to apply and goes on smoothly with no wrinkles or gaps and it removes without taking foundation with it. Leaving you with a nice winged effect to your shadow. Now that I think about it, it should also work for winged eyeliner.
Garnier Whole Blends Softening Shampoo Bar for Fine to Normal Hair, Oat Delicacy, 2 Oz, 1 Count (Packaging May Vary) | My husband recently switched from liquid shampoos to bars and now prefers them. He made the switch after trying several liquid shampoos that not only didn't help his thinning dry hair they irritated his scalp.<br /><br />Garnier, being a well known brand, I wanted him to try this one and right now its his #2 choice from the 4 he's tried. It hasn't irritated his scalp and he's so far happy with how his thinning, fine hair looks and feels.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and I hope this review is helpful

This product is great for redness. It‚Äôs a balmy type product that is non oily or greasy. I used it along my cheeks after a week in the sun and it completely dulled down the little redness I had on my cheeks with out irritating my sensitive skin or feeling thick, greasy or oily. I absolutely recommend this product and I am excited to try other things by this brand! It absorbs well into the skin and the the applicator is this smooth pad that feels soft and smooth when applying the product to my skin. I don‚Äôt recall the product longevity but I only needed to apply it once in the am. I can also appreciate no conflicting ingredients so I could layer this product on ...
I love this color corrector! This is a perfect shade of green to help minimize any redness on the skin. It's incredibly blendable and buildable, letting you apply as much or as little as needed in order to achieve perfect coverage. It's also super refreshing and almost feels cool to the touch while you're applying it.
THE QUALITY OF THIS PACKAGE IS AMAZING I LOVE ALL THE SLOTS FOR EACH PART CAND WAIT TO TRY

Target: This is another interesting Korean skincare product.  The description and images leaves the impression that this is a powder product, in reality, the texture is closer to ELF's putty primer. When I applied it to dry bare skin using the puff it pilled slightly, I did get better results blending it with my finger tips. It leaves an overall light green veil of color on bare skin that's not overly noticeable and leaves a matte finish. Don't let the matte finish fool you though, it melts into your skin leaving it moisturized without feeling greasy.<br /><br />My skin is only slightly sensitive and when irritated doesn't react with major noticeable redness or heat. It did calm the redness I sometimes have around my nose and chin.  I've not yet tested this over or under foundation and wonder if it would work well as a primer? More information regarding the benefits, ingredients and use are on the company's site.

Output: HA is a great addition to foundation. It's a great addition to my foundation.

Love this!! Fits great in smaller spaces.
It dosen't take alot Of space and rotates easily.
Very nice and pretty, too!
I think this is a great looking product that has made my under sink goodies so much more accessible. It looks really nice and is sturdy enough. The only improvement I would make is sturdiness, but it is holding lots of items very solidly. Will likely buy another for hubby.
Love this items worth spending the money on. Liked it so much bought on for my daughter..
Works well
I used it for my make up in my bathroom it's great you can adjust to the size of the product I personally love it
It‚Äôs a Christmas gift that my daughter will LOVE..‚ù§Ô∏è
Better than expected. Very sturdy, high quality.

100 pcs Compressed Facial Mask Women DIY Beauty Facial Cotton Paper Compress Masque Disposable Dry Sheet Mask for Skin Face Care | I wasn't sure what to expect from these compressed facial masks in terms of quality, as reviews were across the board. But, they far exceeded my needs and expectations!<br />They are about the size of three dimes stacked, and are embossed with little flowers on top, which is really just a pretty presentation.<br />They expand easily with moisture, I mixed up my own serum solution with essential oil, and it was easy to soak and unfold. I worried I would have to be super delicate so as not to tear the paper, but these are more of a fabric than tissue.<br />In fact, I opened one up to test it's durability. I used some warm water, added some dish soap and went to town scrubbing my basin. ...
TOUCH IN SOL Flawless Skin Top Coat 1.18 fl.oz. (35ml) - One Step Makeup (Nourishing Ampoule + High Adhesive Makeup Base + Fresh Silky Powder), Moisturizing High Coverage Foundation (#1 Light) | My friend recommended this Touch in Sol Flawless skin top coat, and I am so glad she did.<br />It is really more of a foundation, it has perfect medium coverage. It feels amazing on my skin, light and silky smooth. It leaves me looking matte, but not dry. It's surprisingly radiant.<br />I use it over the Touch in Sol primer, without setting powder, and it easily lasts the whole day.<br />So, here I am recommending it to you! Try it! It's amazing!
The Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine | This is actually a decent palette of eyeshadows. They are not super pigmented, but very easy to work with. This is a very nice beginner palette, especially for the under 10 price.<br />That said, these need a primer. They last an okay amount of time, but will fade quickly if you don‚Äôt use a primer.<br />Simple cardboard container, very similar to colourpop and bh, but doesn‚Äôt have a mirror. Still it‚Äôs sturdy and all the pans arrived unbroken!<br />The shades are arranged nicely, it really has a visual appeal, and makes choosing an eye look easier.<br />It‚Äôs realky not bad, and while my tastes typically run towards the more luxury and pigmented, this is a good entry for a beginner or lighter makeup user.<br />I will be ...
AG Care Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar Leave On Mist | This leave in hair remedy from AG smells wonderful, like a sweet and spicy scent.

Target: These are some pretty fantastic razors. They are straight edged, but the provided safety edging prevents me from nicking myself while keeping the blade close to my skin.<br />It removes peach fuzz quickly, efficiently. My skin is super smooth for about a week after use. My makeup goes on like butter, and I am convinced my moisturizers and serums also work better on my dermaplaned skin.<br />They are small and precision enough that I can use them around my eyebrows, though I go slow and don't usually use them for that.<br />But for my upper lip, chin, cheeks and forehead I don't know how I got by before these. While my easy to use electric is nice, these are so much closer. Will be a faithful weekly user!

Cleansing Bentonite Clay Powder - 1 Lb - Deep Skin Pore and Body Cleanser, All Natural, Detoxifying, Use for DIY facial masks, shampoo, creams, lotions, deodorant etc. by Aspen Naturals | On receipt of this Aspen Naturals Bentonite Clay Amazing Skin and Body Detoxifier, there was a tamper-proof seal in place over the opening of the jar for peace of mind in knowing it arrived to me pure and untampered with. The Bentonite Clay is a fine powder is easy to use with easy-to-follow directions right on the back of the label, although there are many other uses as well. I appreciate that this came well-protected for a safe delivery, which is a big part of a product, to be able to order it and know it will arrive safe and sound.<br /><br />I have used this several times as a face mask mixed with Rose Hydrosol and a drop of Frankincense Essential Oil, which worked perfectly for ...
BEST FACE MASK WITH PINK ROSE CLAY - SPRING SALE - Organic Ingredients - Includes Ebook - Smooths Skin and Reduces Pores, Improves Aging Spots, Redness, Blemishes - Reduces Fine Lines | This Maywood Creek Essentials Rose Clay Mud Mask comes in a nice lightweight plastic jar with a shiny silver lid. The product label contains all the pertinent information, such as directions, ingredients (a lovely blend of natural skin-nurturing ingredients), company information, expiration date, which is about a year out, giving me plenty of time to finish this Rose Clay Mud Mask. Interestingly, the label says to ‚Äúshake well before every use,‚Äù but my mask is a soft solid. This mask has a different texture than I have seen before in a mask, perhaps due to the glycerin. I would say the scent is somewhat of a mix of light roses and (more so) citrus/grapefruit, best I can tell, which would be from the grapefruit and yuzi essential ...

After coming across this conditioner, it sounded perfect for my hair, so I decided to give it a try. The bottle itself is streamline and attractive, containing all of the pertinent information such as ingredients, directions, cautions, company information, and Made in the USA.

Fantastic, I'm in love with this fractionated coconut oil. Love the pump dispenser and large bottle size. I'm an essential oil diyer so this is now in my blends. For those that don't know the fractionated part is just the liquid no need to melt ever. Great to leave by the sink for each and quick moisturizer. For frizzy hair just a little bit will do wonders. I'm very pleased with this coconut oil and all its benefits.
What makes fractionated coconut oil different from the solid kind you can find in the grocery store is that it has gone through a fractional distillation process, by which some of the fatty acids have been removed, allowing it to stay liquid at room temperature. It's a wonderful massage oil, with good slip, and does not have a greasy feel to it. I love using it as a carrier for essential oil blends that I pre-dilute in a roller bottle for convenient application. It has a long shelf life, which makes it great for something that will be used long-term.<br /><br />Above all, this is a vegetable oil, and it will behave as such. Other products labeled &#34;fractionated coconut oil&#34; are often a more processed, esterification of ...
After such a long brutal summer and being outside so much. I was looking for something to help my hair out it taken a beating. This suggested to me that I dry coconut oil to help with dry hair. I also read about all the great benefits of coconut oil and its many uses. But I‚Äôd only seen it and a solid form which I‚Äôve tried but it is on the messy side. After finding this organic liquid coconut oil had been extremely happy not only with how healthy my hair looks with many uses that I found it to use it with. Everything from shaving dry skin for my dogs to dry hair. As well as helping with shaving is a pre-moisturizing oil. I don‚Äôt know ...
This stuff is wonderful! It makes your skin and hair so soft and silky! Plus it doesn't have any smell so you can add a few drops of your favorite essential oils to make it smell however you want! I also love how it come with a pump and a flip top so you have different options on how you can disperse it. It shipped very quickly and got here very fast and in great condition!
I got this to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils. I love it. It's odorless and colorless which I prefer to use with my oils. I did try to use it as a massage as well and it was great! It's not greasy so it didn't stain anything after the massage was over. I also love that it's great to use for dry skin. My daughter has excema and it really helped to relieve her dry skin. I do plan to use it for other things such as a leave in conditioner for my hair as well. I also like that it comes with a pump as well as a push top. It makes it easier to use depending on what I am using ...
This fractionated coconut oil is a great alternative in sterilizing minor scrapes!<br /> Fractionated coconut oil, also called ‚Äúliquid coconut oil,‚Äù is a form of the oil that has had the long-chain fatty acids removed via hydrolysis and steam distillation. Just this one change makes the oil liquid at room temperature, and extends the product‚Äôs shelf life. I use this as a carrier oil to go with my essential oils and for a moisturiizer for dry skin on my arms and legs. I found another use I didn't know about. Sky Organics is full of lauric acid that is renowned for its antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial properties. This fractionated coconut oil is a great alternative in sterilizing minor scrapes, burns, and cuts. So I think I will ...
I want to say first of all that I like to blend my own oils and make some of my own skin and hair care items. I only recently started doing this again, so I do have some experience with different oils.<br />That being said, I used this coconut oil last night, along with some of my other items, and made a small amount of a foot cream that I like. I always do a small batch when using a new brand/product. I don't want to waste anything.<br />First of all this oil blended nicely with the other ingredients. After it cooled overnight, I checked to see how well it set. I check to make sure that there is no separation and that the blending still holds. ...

The order came quickly and the whole is free from damage.<br />This oil is a wonderful surprise. I bought this oil, after doing some research on the natural massage oil, and read that this oil is very light and has no smell.<br />I am very glad this oil really does not smell at all. I add different essential oils and smells amazing.<br /> I found that this oil has an ideal thickness and oiliness. This oil actually slips very well in the skin. It absorbs very well leaving behind only the smell of essential oils, but not that sticky feeling rough.<br />It's great that it comes with a pump dispenser, it is very easy to use.<br />I use it to massage my child and husband, and their ...

The item description is Sky Organics Fractionated Coconut Oil for Body & Face, 100% Pure to Condition, Soften & Smooth, 16 fl. Oz. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: On receipt of this 100% Pure and Natural Fractionated Coconut Oil (Cocos Nucifera) from Sky Organics, it arrived in a plastic bag to protect any other items in my box from possible leakage. It came with a push-top dispenser in place, under which there was a rubber stopper to keep the oil from leaking on its journey to me. Also in the bag was a pump dispenser, should I prefer that. It‚Äôs nice to have the choice of dispensing and the pump dispenser is my choice. It makes it so easy to fill up a little roller bottle or squeeze bottle for my concoctions AND easy to dispense when I use it as an after-shower moisturizer. The label contains all of the pertinent information, such as company contact information, product information, directions and possible uses, ingredients (100% pure medium chain triglyceride oil aka fractionated coconut oil (cocos nucifera), cold-pressed by expelier method), seals earned. I like that this is 100% pure and natural and is odorless and colorless, making it a perfect carrier oil for aromatherapy blends. This Fractionated Coconut Oil is chemical- and additive-free, non-greasy, and eco-friendly.<br /><br />I use this Coconut Oil most of all in my roller ball bottle blends that I make for others and for myself more than any other use, but I also use it as an after-bath moisturizer, either by itself or mixed with my choice of essential oils. I pat it all over while my skin is still slightly damp, allowing it to sink in and keep the moisture in. I like that it is completely scent-free, so any essential oils I may add to my blends doesn‚Äôt need to try to overpower the carrier oil. This is a lovely big bottle and I love the pump dispenser for use one-handed and for ease in filling bottles to just the right height. This oil also has, on its own before even adding essential oils, antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial properties. It makes a lovely massage oil and can blend with other oils for a more rounded benefit. I use this almost every day, which makes this generous 16-ounce size perfect for me. Sky Organics is one of my favorite brands and I will definitely be purchasing this again, although this bottle should last me quite some time.

JPNK 10PCS Makeup tool set, Blender Sponges& Air cushion puff&Sponge Holder for Blending Liquid, Cream or Flawless Powder Cosmetics | You never know what you're gonna get with some of these beauty sponges, but this is definitely one of the good sets.<br /><br />The sponges are actually soft and don't absorb as much product as other sponges.

This cleanser is very effective in removing my makeup including liner and mascara. I bought several cleansing balms that were disappointing lately,but this one works well. It is neither moisturizing nor drying and it has a strong yet beautiful rose scent. It feels luxurious and doesn't seem to leave a film on my face which I appreciate. (I always double cleanse and use toner afterwards however). I really like it and will probably purchase it again.
Good scent, and I like texture. Quantity is not so large. I think it is good for lighter makeups.
I didn't have high hopes for this but I thought I would give it a try. I had also purchased the Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing Balm from the merchant's website so this review will be somewhat of a comparison.<br />This cleansing balm had more of a milky or cream texture than the Green Clean Cleansing Balm which is much more of an oil texture. I like the smell of the Green Clean Cleansing Balm much better; not to say that this smells bad, but the Green Clean smells phenomenal. This has a deeper rose scent.<br />This balm does a MUCH better job of actually removing makeup, whereas the Green Clean seemed to simply move it around. After using the Green Clean Cleansing Balm, I followed up with ...

Target: I tried this a few times and couldn't help but feeling like it left residue on my face. I end up using my normal face wash afterwards to feel properly cleansed.<br /><br />To be fair I don't wear much face makeup so perhaps this might work better for someone that wears foundation. I did try to remove my eye makeup with this balm and it was too greasy/thick and also stung my eyes, whereas my micellar water won't do that.<br /><br />The scent is a nice clean rose scent and I like the packaging, but I don't think I'll continue to use this. Seems like more work than is necessary and kinda makes me feel like it will clog my pores in the long run...

Output: Good scent, and I like texture.

I'm actually impressed with the accuracy of the bundle of all these items, especially for the price.<br /><br />The fact that you are getting a wig, the earrings, the necklace, and the fake teeth in one is really useful so you don't have to scavenge for all the different components.<br /><br />The wig is decent quality, the hairline is a bit weird but the poms for each side attach via an alligator hair clip built in which allows for it to not get as disheveled in storage.<br /><br />The necklace is basically spot on to what it should be which is impressive and awesome to not to have to hunt for as a Cosplayer, to just have everything in one.<br /><br /> The earrings are probably my ...
If you are into cosplay or just historical costumes, then this wig is a lot of fun. It comes with a necklace, earrings and a set of buck teeth. I ditched the teeth. Easy to wear wig which comes with a nice stretchy adjustable cap and a hair net to keep your own locks locked down. It's a fun, creative wig and I hope to see a lot of other styles in the future.<br />The hair itself it auburn. Not too fake looking. The hair line is a bit of a struggle but I got it right .
I am SO excited to wear this costume (Color: Reddish Brown) and become Winifred Sanderson - the red-headed witch in Hocus Pocus! The wig came in three pieces: the main part which you wear on your head and two little buns that have hidden hair claws on the underside to attach to the main wig. There's a black netted wig cap that you need to put on your head before wearing the main wig. There's a necklace and a pair of earrings to go with it (not sure if they really matched her character in the movie, but they work). There are two pairs of front teeth (one large and one small) that you can wear with a temporary adhesive that you can heat up (I think ...
FantaLook Purple and Black Wig with Spider Clip Earrings and Necklace for Halloween Cosplay Party is the best Hocus Pocus Mary Sanderson wig they make!

There are two clip on purple braids and a clip on spider to add to the wig‚Äôs charm. There are also a pair of coral earrings and a silver necklace to add to your costume. The wig has room, and is not tight, and you can tighten it as you like for comfort. It comes with a wig net cap as well, and if it‚Äôs too top heavy for a little one, you can always use a couple bobby ...
This wig (and hair net, fake teeth, necklace, earrings) are very nice! It is full with no dull spots. The two bumps are actually seperate pieces that are attatched to teeth like combs. They were very difficult to get out of the hair nets, actually had to rip them open. As you can see, I attatched them on the lil pony hair bumps, where the character does more to the side of her head. You attatch the bumps yourself, so can place anywhere. They are also very full. I will say, even pulled all the way down my forehead, the front side of the wigs are a bit short. You can see the last two pictures a lot of my natural hair showing through, so this must ...
it is perfect for Halloween. The wig ahas a clip inside that way it doesn‚Äôt slide off of your head. It comes with accessories too. It also comes with a net to put into your head before.
[[VIDEOID:724e2a59d86ba434611ed2eecdb9f0e1]] I absolutely love this wig and was extremely surprised that it came fully styled and exactly to the pictures. I definitely recommend it and I can't wait to wear it!
So I wear and review a lot of wigs and I have started breaking the review down into sections that I think will be helpful. Note this wig comes with Spider Clip (on large braid in picture), earrings, and a silver necklace (also pictured) - Not pictured - 2 clip in thin braids that I didn't use.<br /><br />Color - Purple and black - obviously supposed to be a Mary Sanderson look from Hocus Pocus (although hers is a little redder) - not named as such though probably for licensing reasons.<br /><br />Styling- This is a take out the bag and put on ready to go wig. There is an adjustable band at the back with minimal adjusment but it was enough to fit it securly. The ...
We are huge hocus pocus fans in this house!<br />This wig is very true to the movie, it's high quality, well made and so cute, my kids went crazy when they seen me wearing it.<br />The jewelry accessories are a wonderful bonus.<br />I would recommend.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review I hope that it was helpful to you.
This wig was great for the money. I believe it's a Carol Baskin style wig, but I bought it to be a Celtic queen. It was bent at the bottom from being folded in the package, so I wet it and even used a straightener to try and "unbend" it. It mostly worked. I ended up trimming all of the bottom to make it look less scraggly (although in the full-length picture, it still looks that way. üòÑ) Anyway, the wig was fine for my costume.

Came expired by 6 months :(
I fell asleep in the Sun in Miami. A friend told me about Sunbrunt. They did not have it CVS, so course I ordered it from Amazon. I felt relief the moment I put it on.
Expired product. I wish I would‚Äôve read reviews before buying.. really needed this for vaca!
Keep it in the kitchen - immediately soothes burns
Love love love. Sunburn one day, put this on and it turns to a tan by the next day or day after with no peeling
No matter how much sunscreen I apply & reapply I burn! Went kayaking for a day, got burned pretty bad. Nothing helped soothe the pain or moisturize the burn. Purchased this product a local retailer. As soon as I applied it I felt an immediate difference. No more pain & completely moisturizing. It worked so well I went out with friends that night and went back out kayaking the next day. I call it my skin restorer. It's the only product I will use on my skin after a day in the sun. It works! I order from Amazon now & always have it available. Living in Florida I'm always in the sun.
Great product
Great product but the seller sent me an expired one....that doesn‚Äôt make me too happy.
Both of the ones I ordered were expired so just make sure to check the dates.
Feels good but gave me ZERO pain relief.

The item description is SunBurnt PLUS Pain Relief Gel for After Sun, 5 oz - Non-sticky Pain Relief with Lidocaine, Aloe, Calendula. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: This stuff is the best that I have found for after sun care. Last year my husband and son were in a fishing tournament and had forgotten to put on sunscreen. By the end of the day they both came home really burnt. My son got it really bad on his face and nose.  So I went to Walmart to buy something to help give them some relief. Everything was pretty much sold out  except one really small tube of the SunBurnt Gel. I almost didn't buy it because it was kind of pricey and pretty small. I decided though to give it a try since it was my only option. I put it on both my husband and son and immediately they felt a huge relief from the pain. They said the gel instantly took the heat out of the burn and cooled it down. Then by the next morning I was so shocked to see that they both looked like they never even got burned at all and neither of them were in pain. A few days later my son did start to peel a little on his face. So I used the rest of the sun burnt gel and it actually took the peeling away. His face looked normal again within minutes and didn't  peel again after that. My husband didn't even peel at all. I was thinking maybe we just got lucky because there was no way this product had those results in one day, but I found out this year that it definitely was the sunburnt gel that helped. This year, right before summer I found this one for a great deal. I remembered paying alot last year. I also wanted to try it again, so I decided to buy it and store it away until I needed it. Well last weekend my husband went fishing and forgot to put sunscreen on again. He came home burnt pretty bad. So we tried sunburnt gel again and the same thing as last year happened. By the next morning it was a huge improvement. This time he had to put it on twice, but we are still so amazed with how well this stuff works. For now on this is the only after sun care product that my family and I will buy.

Output: review: Great product Great product but the seller sent me an expired one

Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | This is a nice set of six nail polishes, all in identical black bottles. I assume this is because the polishes are light sensitive and so the black bottles protect all of them from degrading due to harsh lighting. As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would ...
Gents of London Design Paste Matt Firm Hold Professional Hair Styling Wax (3 oz) | I think it works better as a styling wax - it didn't stiffen my hair as much as I would have liked, but the cream made it a breeze to style. The scent is a little strong but it's pleasant. I think this product could be used by both men and women though it's obviously intended for men. This product is made in England and the graphics are pleasant to look at it - it has a quaint Victorian vibe about it. Overall I'm pleased with the product but the price could be better
Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum with Natural Mango Micro-beads, Vitamins E and C, Natural and Organic Plant Extracts, Paraben-Free, 30 ml, Made in France, Phytema | I love the scent of this anti-aging serum but I didn't notice any significant effects on the wrinkle beneath my right eye. In addition, the microbeads don't dissolve easily and I had to rub the serum several times before they were absorbed by my face. I also recently learned microbeads are also bad for the environment because they can poison fish if they're disposed of in drains and end up in the ocean. So I won't be ordering any more products with this ingredient.
10 Pcs Brown and 10 Pcs Black Wig Grip Headband for women | This headband is soft and flexible. It keeps my hair from falling into my eyes when I do my morning routine of washing my face. It's also great for holding your hair back after you shampoo and making it easier to style. It can also be washed after every use and dries quickly because the material isn't too thick. Overall it's of a good quality.
Bouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz | I have a weakness for beautifully decorated soap bottles. This Bouquet Garni bottle looks great and I'm tempted to use this as a hand soap rather than as a body wash just so I can display it on my sink. As for the scent, "White Musk" I don't like it as much. It's OK, but I prefer lavender but thought I'd give it a try. As a wash, it foams up nicely and leaves my skin feeling soft and cleansed. It's made in Korea, home to many high qualty skin care companies so I trust its quality (more so than if it's from China!).<br /><br />Again, I love the bottle so I'll be sure to re-use it after the body wash is all gone, but if I ...
Kneipp Shower Foam Goodbye Stress Water Mint & Rosemary 6.81 Oz | The only thing I didn't like about this shower "foam" is how quickly it will be used up. It comes in a relatively small caninster and it comes out like shaving foam, only it's for the body and not for the face. It feels great and helps clear my stuffed sinuses. The scent is "mint and rosemary" but I feel like it's mostly mint. It's a step up above your ordinary shower gel but it won't likely last as long, as it's hard to tell how much of the bottle you are actually using since it's not liquid. Except for that caveat, I liked this.
CLAIR BEAUTY Hyaluronic & Retinol Day Cream & Facial Serum Collection Gift Set - Hydrating, Rejuvenating & Anti Aging | Reduces Wrinkles & Fine Lines | Locks in Moisture, Smoothing & Evening Skin Tone | Considering it's low price point, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this set performed on my skin. I have dry patches on my cheeks and the moisturizer worked really well at keeping my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I didn't like the eye serum as much (I didn't see much of a difference) but it didn't irritate my skin so both products are decent for the price.
Beast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast | This is a strongly scented mens body wash with notes of ginseng, green tea, menthol and Vitamin B. Caffeine is also listed as an ingredient. The menthol and the ginseng scents overpower the rest. It lathers up very well and imparts a cooling sensation that makes you tingle all over and even clears your sinuses! I would recommend this body wash for people with colds because this really helps. I love it.
Biutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED | I already have a number of gel nail polishes but I love the iridescent glitter of these nail polishes. They are very sparkly and the gel lasts a long time. It's a small set so it will be used up fairly quickly. The only thing I didn't like about it was the strong chemical odor of the polish but it dissipates after awhile. Except for this, I love the look of this nail polish.
UV LED Nail Lamp ‚Äì 128W Rapid-Curing Gel Nails Dryer for Manicures and Pedicures ‚Äì Dual-Voltage with Extra-Long Cable, Multi-Language Manual ‚Äì Professional Gel Lamp for Homes or Salons by OVLUX, Gold | I've reviewed many nail lamps and I like this one because of the color, the ease of operation and how quickly it dries my nails. It has a wide mouth so you can put both hands in if your hands are small and the same goes with your feet.<br />The LED screen is bright and easy to read. It has a strong UV light but you can adjust the speed so you can use just enough to dry your nails (too much may be bad for your hands). Overall it's a decent nail lamp but the price feels a little high for this type of item.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
This headband is just beautiful. Has a cleaning cloth as well. Can‚Äôt wait to wear.
Its beautiful and big.. But tight on your head.
This headband is super cute. The color is gorgeous. It was made really well. I did not find any flaws. It fit my head comfortably. It doesn't feel too tight. It's a cute Christmas gift.
Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter and she loves it!
It's not what I was hoping for. It's not as light and it's just an odd fit. It's also not as sparkly as pictured. It's rather kind of dull looking. I don't like the way it sits on my head or they way it looks. In the advertised pictures, it doesn't show that it sticks out so much, it looks more flush.
When the item was received the headband inner seam was coming apart from the headband base. For the price I was very disappointed in this purchase and would not purchase again.

The item description is Hetianmei¬Æ Pink Rhinestone Headbands for WomenÔºåJewel HeadbandÔºåBling Diamond Headbands Crystal Fashion Sparkly Jeweled Thick Headbands for Woman. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I'm disappointed in the look of this pink jeweled headband. The crystal beads look cheap and the headband seems made for a teenage girl. I was hoping for sparkly pink rhinestones but they're actually plastic faceted beads, the same kind you'd sew on the cuff of a sweater. They're kind of blah and look chintzy. It comes in a zip loc bag with a dust cloth with the company's unpronounceable name printed on it. Disappointed.

Output: I'm not sure how much it's worth.

Reusable Shower Cap for Women ‚Äì Leakproof, Nonslip Hair Cap for Shower w/ Comfy Flexiband ‚Äì Soft, Breathable Shower Caps for Women Reusable Waterproof ‚Äì Durable, Heavy Duty Shower Cap by SMPL OBJECTS (Marble) | This is a quality shower cap I have been looking for. I have long, thick hair and sometimes after straightening my hair I just want to wash my body, I would have to tie or clip my hair up. But unfortunately, water still ends up wetting my hiar. The shower cap material is good quality. It is thick and waterproof. The cute, floral design is a plus and there is a cute bow in the front. Inside there is a silicone band that will hold the cap in place so I don't have to worry about the cap falling off. I have worn the cap around the house just to keep hair out of the way and it doesn't hurt my head. It has been super useful ...
3 Packs Wig Stand Holder,Portable Wig Hanger for All Wigs Long and Short Hair and Hats,Durable Collapsible Travel Wig Stands Display Tool Dryer Holder(3 Pack, Pink) | This wig stand contains 3 individual stands. For shoulder length and short hair the stands are perfect but for long hair doesn't work. They do not extend far enough to accommodate the long length. The sturdiness is okay. The instructions that came with the stands are unfortunately in Chinese without translation so assembling was quite confusing at first.
Travel Bottles for Toiletries, Silicone Travel Size Bottles And Squeezable Containers Holders with belt clip Keychain for Backpack, Shampoo, Liquid, Cosmetic Products(2 oz, 6 Pack) | I am using these for hand sanitizers. The order comes with 3 white, 1 pink, light blue, and blue. They are silicone tubes with white plastic caps. It comes with black key chain holder so it‚Äôs portable. Each tube holds 60 ML. I put high alcohol content hand sanitizer so it‚Äôs more liquid than gel. Unfortunately I have to be extra careful for the liquid to not spill out when using. Otherwise the tubes should be able to contain the get and you‚Äôd just squeeze the tube. The bottle itself is spill proof. The cap is sealed tight. It is easy to refill through the wide mouth opening to fill up with any content.
Gel Nail Polish Set, Holiday Red Black 6 Colors Gel Polish Kit Popular Nail Art Design Soak Off LED Lamp Nail Polish Gel Manicure Kit Gifts Set for Girls Women Professional DIY Home Use | The order comes with six different colored gel nail polish. The strange thing is, there are no colors labeled on the bottle. There‚Äôs a sticker for you to apply the gel and cure on sheet of white circle stickers to put on the bottle yourself. I found this strange and did not like it at all. The color swatches that I applied the gel polish to had the colors coming off of the sticker so I have to open the bottles to check the colors..<br /><br />There set comes with six different colors -<br />15 - black<br />16 - white<br />17 - dark purple<br />18 - dark brown/grey<br />19 - light beige<br />20 - red<br /><br />I like the basic colors. The gel quality I would say ...

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Super convenient and they work amazing I love the color options and they could work in a goodie bag for a girls trip! Super fun idea and they dry well too! They have a loop to wrap around a button so it keeps in place!
I'm pleased with this set of microfiber hair towels. They are so much nicer than I expected at this price point. After a shower, at the pool, the beach, or the gym are all places where I like to wrap my hair after it gets wet. These towels are a nice, generous size that will work for any length of hair. They're lightweight so they're easy to take out and about. They launder and dry well.
I still have to figure out how to use these properly. I will ask my daughter to show me/. They are so soft.. I wish I had a nightgown like that

The item description is Microfiber Hair Towels - 5 Towel Set ‚Äì 5 Beautiful Colors - Great for all Hair Types - Size (10 x 26 inches) Lightweight, Absorbent, and Ultra Soft. Colors Rose, Pink, Gray, Blue, and Lilac. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I have long and thick hair and it's always a hassle to dry them. I have been purchasing different types of microfiber hair towels and I want to say this is one of the best out there. First of all, many claim that their product works for long hair but when I try them I usually get a good length of hair sticking out. The towel is never long enough to cover the length of my hair. However, I was so happy to find that this microfiber towel covered my entire hair. The towels are absorbent and keeps my hair drying nicely without the use of a hair dryer, which tends to create a lot of fizz. The only thing is that because the towel is longer and larger than usual, it tends to slip. I recommend wrapping the hair before tying on to the button to keep the towel tightly wrapped around your hair. Other than that, I have no complaints with the product.

Output: Great product!

CESTLV Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush + Toothpaste Kit (10 Pack Bulk), Hotel Amenities for Guest & Travel, BPA Free, Individually Boxed Dental Kits, Recyclable | Very decent bamboo toothbrush. Generally the bristles are too soft for me. This one is medium-soft. So at least it feels like my mouth is clean after brushing. Lightweight, no guilt. Even the packaging is made from recycled material. Great to have multi pack!
lilah b. - Bronzed Beauty Bronzer Duo - b. sunkissed - Multipurpose Bronzer Duo to Highlight + Contour and Blend | This is such a high end product. The weighted compact feels sleek and heavy in your hand. The slide/pivot opening is clever and works smooth. The color saturation is rich and deep and looks flawless on many skin tones. Not too much shimmer, so it actually looks like you've been sun kissed after application. Buildable color if you want a more intense look. You can use both colors together, which is what I do. I am medium complexion, blonde, 48 years old. This product doesn't increase pores size, nor does it settle into any wrinkles. In my opinion, deserving of more than 5 stars.
I WOKE UP LIKE THIS Turn-over Rice Perfect Oil Foam Cleanser ‚Äì A Hypoallergenic Cleansing oil, Foaming Face Wash with Rice Bran Extract. Makeup Removal, Deep Facial Cleansing for Sensitive Skin | I love oil based cleansers and don't use anything else. But they are not for everyone. My 20 year old daughter doesn't like this product, while I think it's one of the best I've used. The smell is subtle and I love the suppleness of my skin after cleaning!
Lovrio 20" 20 Pcs 50g Glue Hair Extensions Piano Color Dirty Blonde mixed with Light Golden Blonde P18-22 Seamless in Human Hair Hair Extensions With Adhensive Tape | Of all the extensions I've ordered, this is my least favorite. The blonde has so much brass in it! It's almost red in color. (I put a few pictures with my review. The lighter blonde is the color that I expect when I order blonde.) There are also more dark black strands coursing thru these pieces than any other brand I've used. Maybe it's just this particular color? Comes with clips, which is nice. And hair is soft.
Organic Labs - Eyelash & Eyebrow Growth Serum - Enhancer Treatment to Grow Natural, Lush, Lavish Eyelashes & Eyebrows - Best Rapid Brow & Lash Boost for Longer, Fuller Lashes and Thicker Brows | I only received 1 tube of eyelash serum. I apply it right at my lash line, as directed, on a clean face. Have not seen any notable difference. Does not sting or irritate my eyes.
C.O. Bigelow No. 007 Dr Hiosous Quince Hand Lotion, 4 Ounces | This stuff is wonderful. It's been a game changer for my hands this winter. There is very little scent. Which suprised me because it's filled with so many natural extracts like apple, lemon, carrot, aloe, grapefruit. The directions suggest to put on before bed and slip cotton gloves on. I'm not planning on doing that because I'm not 80, but am still very impressed at how long my hands feel protected and moisturized.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
A few weeks ago, I tried a different brand of purple conditioner. This was the first time I'd ever used any purple conditioner on my blond hair. After using the other brand, I noticed a subtle change to the brassiness in my hair. While I was satisfied with the results, I also assumed it had done all it could do for my hair. Tonight, I tried WELLUTION Purple Hair Mask (for blonds). The mask is easy to apply and it distributes nice and even on my hair. My hair is thick and shoulder length. It didn't take much mask to cover all of my hair. ( I did put extra mask on my roots/scalp area because I do dye my roots) I let the mask sit on ...
We used this on long hair that was mostly previously bleached and with 3" of newly bleached roots that were a lemon yellow color. We hoped to remove the yellow on the newly bleached areas, but the affect was minimal. It still looked yellow, just a little less so. We tried several similar products and had similar results, so I suspect that we just are dealing with hard-to-tone hair. In the end, we had to use a semi-permanent dye in a darker shade. This product did, however, have a nice conditioning affect.
I really like this purple hair mask. I got promotion discount through snagshout so I figured no loss if I didn‚Äôt care for it. I had pictures but honestly did show much. I already use purple shampoo n conditioner for brassiness. My hair natural dark blond with some natural highlights. Although I didn‚Äôt see big difference in brassiness (I think because of already using shampoo n conditioner) my hair felt soft and healthier then my normal routine. I‚Äôd deduct 1star only because I didn‚Äôt see much color difference ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But that might be on me. I‚Äôd buy again to use as weekly or monthly hair mask definitely worth the price. Nice job
Smells good, hair felt softer and tone/colour appeared less brassy after first use!
I‚Äôm outside a lot in the summer and my hair sees a lot of sun and chlorine from the pool. It‚Äôs also becoming lighter with more grey. I was excited about trying this. I‚Äôve used it for a few days and adult didn‚Äôt notice a huge change in the tone. It does feel somewhat softer though<br />I‚Äôm also not a fan of the packaging. There isn‚Äôt a pump or squeeze bottle. You just stick your hand in the jar.
I wish I had taken before and after photos...<br /><br />My hair is naturally bright golden blonde. I have been sick of it for a while and wanted to finally change it. I box dyed my hair for the first time ever what was supposed to be 2 shades darker about a month ago. It only got maybe 1/2 or 3/4 of a shade darker but at least it was something. I wanted to try again but was waiting a little bit before dying again so I didn't damage my very fine hair. Wanted to try this in the meantime to take out more of the yellow...<br /><br />I washed my hair like normal and dried it until it was just damp. (Did not use any other ...
Lid was broken when it arrived. Didn‚Äôt notice too much of a difference in lighting my blonde or removing bronze. For $20 there are definitely better products on the market. I normally use Pravana but tried this. Will gp back to pravana
Lo utilice para mi calle yo pero no funciono
This shampoo took all the brassiness color out!!!
This really helps to keep the blonde alive. Just massage it in an leave it for about 10 minutes and rinse. It also leaves my hair and scalp feeling nice and soft. I‚Äôve already used this type of Conditioner and Shampoo, so this is a good boost on top of those.<br /> I think it‚Äôs well worth trying and I‚Äôm glad I did.<br /> Stay Healthy Everyone!ü§™

The item description is Purple Hair Mask for Blonde with Keratin & Jojoba Oil - Platinum & Silver Hair - Instantly Eliminate Brassiness & Yellows - Made in USA - Hair Toner - Bleached & Highlighted Hair - Sulfate Free - 8 oz. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: This masks works great! My hair is blonde and fine and tends to go brassy if not processed correctly. Using this mask is an easy way to freshen and brighten. Not too thick, almost whipped in texture. Totally moisturizes and rinses out without heavy residue.

Output: My hair was a little greasy and it was a little too thick for my hair. I'm not sure if it was the conditioner or the conditioner itself, but I'm sure it was.
