Used this on a PS4 Pro and it worked great- clear sound from the game and in chatting. It's bulky but not heavy and comfortable to wear- even for hours at a time. The mic is a good length and able to bend a bit, if needed. The cord seems durable and connected well to the PS4 controller. The controls for the headset itself all work good. All around, a good headset üëç
The quality of the sound is more than the price paid. These headphones will give ones that I paid 10 times the price a run for their money. The cord is plenty long for gaming I just used them on ps4 along with virtual gear and the experience was awesome. I love the way they fit and can't hear much else if anything when wearing this product. One thing I love is the mute Microphone option on them it comes in handy. You won't go regret this purchase and the can't beat the price.<br /><br />Note<br />My reviews are honest no matter the product nor the price I paid . If my review helped you in your purchase take a moment and click helpful.
These headphones have really decent quality for some budget headphones. The sound is pretty clear coming through and the ear pieces are super cushy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where these headphones fall short for me is the fit. They don‚Äôt fit snug at all, it‚Äôs almost as if the ear pieces just hang off the top of my ears. It‚Äôs definitely usable, but loose fitting in my opinion.<br /><br />Other than that, they are pretty monster headphones, so just be sure you‚Äôre ready to be wearing size huge. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with the size of the headphones if they fit better. I‚Äôm too afraid to make sudden movements because they feel like they will slip off.
Audio is basic stereo, and nothing to write home about. At best, similar to stock headphones you get with your phone or mp3 player.<br /><br />Comfort on the the other hand is another story.<br /><br />Love the padding on ear cups and head rest. Can wear for extended amount of time without any discomfort.<br /><br />Mic quality is basic. Similar to mic audio on smartphones.<br /><br />In line controls are huge (for some reason). Has volume slider and mute (on/off) switch. Has enough raised texture/grooves that you're able to blind use the sliders<br /><br />Works with any device with a 3.5mm headphone jack. Includes a splitter for PC users. Main wire is not detachable from headset<br /><br /> Overall, one of the most comfortable headsets i've tried. ...
While this gaming headset by Chamvict is certainly not the best sounding headset I have ever used, it is a very good budget headset. The sound quality is basic stereo; no surround sound enhancements here. However, it is clear and crisp stereo sound. The mike came through loud and clear using the windows microphone set up and by way of feedback from fellow gamers. The ear cups are the over the ear type and completely cover my ears blocking out outside noise. The ear cups are soft and well padded. The headband and ear cups are among the most comfortable I have ever used. I gave them to my son to use over the weekend. He played BFV and Death By Daylight with his buddies all weekend. ...
They appear to be made well, but the fit isn't great... I could not get them to stay in place on my head and the earphones don't seal well around the ear. Sound was loud enough, but not very clear. The mic seems to work ok. Everyone could hear me just fine.
When I opened the packaging and examined the hardware of these headphones, I thought I would hate it. The head support on top (the black band) has too much play and I didn't expect they would hold well. The set is very large and heavy lending to my belief. However, when I actually used them I was pleasantly surprised. I was able to wear these for three hours without any slippage issues. The loose band actually seemed to help with comfort, and I found that I didn't have many of the long term use issues I have with some other units (strain, discomfort, things like that).<br /><br />Sound quality is equal to or better than some others I've tried. I have hearing loss, so my impression of ...

Target: Headphones are so expensive now a days, so these are at a great price point.  They work perfect for gaming, especially if you are doing online gaming as they do have a microphone.  They do not have too many features, but our a nice pair if you are looking for some.

AMAJULIE Non Slip Flexible Silicon Wigs Fix Strong Hold Comfort Silicone Lace Wig Grip Transparent Headband Hair Band Adjustable for Lace Wigs (Light Brown) | This is a great option for full or frontal lace wigs. I like that it's not too thick, and even though it's a bit tight, it's not uncomfortable.
20 PCS Zoostliss Nail Polish Remover Clips | I recently started doing dip nails and they're definitely more work to remove than normal polish. But I like these clips to ensure that the acetone is really working into the polish and isn't sliding.
NATWAG Reusable Update Makeup Remover Cloths for Sensitive Skin - Microfiber Face Cloth Makeup Remover | Washable Round Makeup Remover Pads | Natural Facial Towels (2 Pads,2 Cloth) (Purple) | I LOVE makeup removing cloths. I don't use them solo ‚Äî only with a makeup remover or micellar water. But these things are great because they're gentle on your skin and are far more economical and environmentally friendly than using disposable wipes.
6 Pack Soft Headband BEoffer Coral Fleece Women Makeup Spa Head Bands Turban Fashion Bow Bowknot Hairlace Headwear Wash Face Hair Holder Elastic Top Knot Bandage Girl Baby Hair Accessories 6 Colors | I like these because they keep my baby hairs back when I'm giving myself a home facial. And I love that there are multiples so I'm never without a hairband even when one or more are in the laundry.
short bob human hair wigs lace front human hair wigs straight bob wigs natural color | I'm always nervous about ordering human hair wigs through Amazon because you never know what you're going to get but this one was nice. I've been thinking about cutting my actual hair into an angled bob but wanted to test run the length first. So I got this wig and I love how it looks. I also love that I was able to lightly bleach highlights into the wig and the hair took it easily. So the quality on this wig is great.
JPNK 10PCS Makeup tool set, Blender Sponges& Air cushion puff&Sponge Holder for Blending Liquid, Cream or Flawless Powder Cosmetics | These are great sponges. Sometimes when you buy knockoff versions of a Beauty Blender, they can be hard or don't work like you would expect. But these sponges are soft and work great wet or dry.
Gifts for Dad from Daughter Son, Unique Fathers Day Christmas Birthday Gift Ideas for Men Father Him, Cool Gadgets Stocking Stuffers for Men, 16 in 1 Stainless Steel Manicure Set (Zang Cyan) | My husband is ALWAYS trying to "borrow" pieces from my manicure kit. In particular, he always tries to take my cuticle nippers and nail clippers ‚Äî and then doesn't put them back. So, then when I need them, I can't find them...not cool. So I'm giving him this as one of his many Christmas gifts because I'm tired of chasing him for my stuff. He'll say he doesn't need it...but he does!

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
The wig I received is exactly as pictured. It only needed a bit of flat ironing and mousse to flatten and smooth out the hair. The density of the hair makes the wig look realistic. It doesn't look like one of those super thick, fake looking cosplay wigs.
[[VIDEOID:72e40b375d7af89d559ebe974451737f]] I really liked this wig, I found it very easy to style and work with. My install and style took less than 30 minutes, the parting space is pretty nice, looks natural. The lace color blended well for my skin tone, and the hair was pretty soft. A little more on the silky side btw. Overall, I think it‚Äôs a great wig for the price, You can check out my full install and review on my YouTube channel, AModelQueen.
The wig is thin in the middle. It can still cover my head without being so noticeable. I enjoyed wearing this wig because of how awesome it looked on me. It feels so soft and smooth.
[[VIDEOID:9118ad20b0e9a447f9b3a276479f331c]] Wow! This hair is gorgeous! Very nice thickness for a 20 inch and silky to the touch with so much body. The closure is perfect on this wig as well! Just to give you guys an idea of the body of this hair I uploaded videos but excuse me for still having my edges wrapped up lol
This wig is very unrealistically thin. It tangled in the back a lot; I had to return.
Very soft not thick but I like the density. It is a little large for my head but overall the hair looks and feels great!

Target: I'm glad I got this for free through the Vine program. The length on this hair is nice, but it's definitely thin like others have mentioned. And I'm not just talking about the bangs. The bangs are ridiculously thin ‚Äî¬†to the point where you would rather they hadn't given it bangs. It doesn't look at all like the product description photo. I have yet to color and layer this wig, but it would definitely be a backup option rather than a daily go to choice.

12ML Refillable Perfume Atomizer Bottle for Travel Spray Scent Pump Case Pack of 5 | These are a hit and miss. Some work, some don't. I got these for my husband because he has an extensive cologne collection and he likes to buy and sell. Some of them leaked and didn't fill well. 2 were useable.
Purifying Face Oil for Natural Skin Radiance - Vegan, Anti Aging Face Oil for Women & Men - Ultra Hydrating and Nourishing Face Oil for Dry Skin Sensitive - Ayurveda Oil for Face by Iryasa - 1 fl.oz | While this does absorb into your skin, I don't like the feel of it, it also made my skin breakout. I'm surprised that I'm the only one to say this. While it seems to have good ingredients, it's not for me
Beurer Luxury Pedicure Foot Spa | Foot Bath Spa with Heat and Massage | Variable Water Temperature | Portable Foot Soaking Tub for Relaxing Foot Reflex Zone Massage, FB13, White | I'm a fan of pedicures. I get one every other week, sometimes my daughter goes as well. I used this on myself and my 5 yr old. This isn't any better than the Conair we own. It doesn't do anything special to warrant such a high price of 68.47. We both liked it as a fun little thing to do at home but we won't be skipping the salon.
Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/towel (3) Blue Yellow and Pink | I don't know how I never heard of this before. I love this, it feels a little rough but my skin has gotten used to it and I love how my skin feels. I had some acne problems on my back during the summer and within a couple weeks, all gone no problems what so ever. I tried to use it on my daughter but she says it hurts, so it's back to wash cloths as after reading an article on loofahs, those will never be in my house every again. This dries well and it's perfect for your back without having to buy a different bath item.
Magnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Kit, Magnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, 5 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelashes with Tweezer, False Lashes | These don't work if you are korean and don't have eyelids. My eyelashes are straight and when you put these on, you can see my straight lashes. Also some of them are over the top and not right for me. I liked 2 pairs but it was so hard to put on and it looked good except my straight lashes that show.
The Henna Guys Hair Finishing Stick, Frizz Control Hair products, Broken Baby Hair Gel - Hair Wax Stick for Flyaway Hair - Faster & Quickest Solution for Neat Hair Styles (1 Pack) | I put this in my girls hair because they have all these baby hairs. At first I was like WOW! and then a few min later of normal activities, I see that their baby hairs all over the place. UGH
Butecare Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum for Long - Amazon Vine | This made my eyes water like crazy, it was so awful I had to just wash my face and it still watered after. I threw it in the garbage.
PARWIN Infrared Flat Iron 1 1/4 Inch Digital Hair Straightener Iron with Ceramic Tourmaline Plate Temperature Control Hair Iron Christmas Gift Black | I love this flat iron. It's easy to use, doesn't get hot and does a great job of straightening and curling. It is easy and simple to use as well as the heat functions. I use this and my flat iron that is like 8 years old. I use this on both my 3 yr old, my 7 yr old and myself.
AuroTrends Makeup Remover Towel,2 Pack Reusable Chemical-free Microfiber Makeup Remover Cloths,Magically and Gently Wipe Away Cosmetics,Sunscreen,Oil and Dirt,Set of 2 (Pink+Black) | It's super plush but it's so small, it makes for a good bath cloth. My girls love how soft it is and they use it in the tub. The hooks are nice to hang up to dry. It's well made and thick, it's not thin at all.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I bought this to keep my hands clean on-the-go, and it's perfect size for my pocket. Love the scent and huge bonus that it's only 30% alcohol and doesn't leave my hands dry or smelling like tequila like other sanitizers.
Makes my hands clean while not drying them out! It feels like I am putting on lotion! My hands are so dry from washing them all day. This keeps my hands soft, smooth, and clean all day. I love it. I definitely will be buying more!
I was searching for a hand wash that wasn‚Äôt going to dry my skin with the high alcohol content. Luckily, I found this product which has worked very well for me the first few applications. Just be sure to fasten the lid tightly after each use!
It works and feels good on the skin, smooth and moisturizing. I can tell that it is a better quality product than your average hand sanitizer. But I found the smell unpleasant and overpowering, so I don't like to use it.<br />I also found the little screw on cap to be inconvenient when trying to put sanitizer on.
This is a nice gift for yourself or loved ones. It‚Äôs a nice sized bottle with a lot of product. The cap is a hard plastic screw and the outside is like a hard durable metal/foil material. The product smells fresh and my hands feel clean after using it. Pretty moisturizing!
This handwash is great! It didn't not make my hands feel wo dry and it smell so good.
This rinse-free hand wash is very practical and good to have on hand, especially after 2020.<br /><br />-The bottle is very small, which is good (easily fits in your pocket) and bad (not the best value).<br />-The scent has a very strong alcohol odor. I'm sure they have to use a lot of alcohol so that it will evaporate quickly without the need to rinse, but it's very strong. After the alcohol smell has worn off, however, they do leave your hands smelling clean.<br />-It "lathers up" pretty well. Just a small pea-sized dollop is good enough to wash my hands. That lathering is what separates it from ordinary hand sanitizer, in my opinion.<br /><br />Maybe my nose is just more sensitive to the scent of alcohol, ...
I've started using this product to moisturize my hands after the gym, and just throughout the day. Overall, I'm quite happy with it! My hands are in better shape with the added bonus of some additional cleansing.
I really like this stuff! I didn't get this for Covid, I got this because I have always been a very frequent hand washer. I hate oils or anything sticky on my hands. So being able to have something like this in my purse is key. I also wanted it to have when out camping or doing outdoorsy stuff where you don't always have access to a sink and water. Until this, I usually carried wet wipes/baby wipes, but this is a more environmentally friendly option that I'm onboard with. I really like the smell, the feel, and the way it absorbs and doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky. Does the job and I've ordered more.

Target: My husband uses this at school and says he likes it but he says there's no way he'd pay $7 for it, especially when the CDC says 62% alcohol. He's right.... 30% alcohol right now isn't enough. Bummer.

Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | Well, I do have a setting light. These polishes work fine. I think some of the premium ones, like OPI, work better, and are easier to see what colors are in the bottle. But, for the price they are OK. Gel polish is a pain to use.
Wahl Smart Shave Rechargeable lithium ion wet / dry water proof foil shaver for men. Smartshave technology for shaving, trimming, and wet or dry shave with precision ground trimmer blade #7061-900 | My husband is very happy with this razor. I think of Wahl as a hair clipper and probably wouldn't have thought of them when replacing his razor, but I am glad to have learned that they make just as good of a quality razor. He uses a regular razor in the shower, then runs an electric around to catch any missed spots. Because of this the battery doesn't need to be charged very often. The battery life indicator is very helpful as is the razor's ability to charge very quickly. He likes it. He is not raving about it being the best razor ever, but we are both happy with this unit.
Neutrogena Fragrance-Free Lightweight Body Oil for Dry Skin, Sheer Moisturizer in Light Sesame Formula, 8.5 fl. oz | The oil itself is great, but to me it smells like suntan oil. I use coconut oil, also scented but very lightly and it dissipates quickly, after a shower. Although I love Neutrogena stuff and use many of their products, I will stick to [[ASIN:B00P8CQK90 Fractionated Coconut Oil - 100% Pure Premium Grade - PUMP + SQUEEZE CAP + FREE Recipe eBook! - BIG 16Oz - Best Carrier Oil & Base For Essential Oils, Aromatherapy & Massage - Great for Roll-On Bottles - Soothing for Skin & Hair!]]

There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus ...
I am very careful with heat that I apply to my hair and I don't use it often, just to keep the hair free from split ends. This worked much better than I anticipated. The infrared didn't seem to hurt my hair and it doesn't have a bunch of frizzees from where it will fall off if the heat is too high. I have had beauticians use to much heat and have that happen. I am pleased with this iron.
Daughters hair is hard to hold style. This is great! Just as described. Leaves hair soft and smooth with no frying. Easily make nice curls too!!
[[VIDEOID:fc4cd002407516a19c344afe591fae81]] We gave this as a gift to our daughter's friend that spent Christmas vacation with us. She absolutely loved it. See Video for a breakdown of specific features.
I absolutely love it!

I have used several styling tools in my life, some were very expensive, this flat iron is comparable to any I have used. The temperature control helps prevent heat stress to your hair and the infrared heat is less damaging. I recommend this product.
Love this. It heats up very quickly and I like all the temperatures you can set it on.

Bride and Bride Tribe bachelorette hair ties, Set of 7 Bachelorette Party Hair Ties, To have and to hold your hair back hair ties, Bachelorette goodie bags, (Black Bride Tribe) | These are very well made hair ties, Colors are nice looking, no smudged / odd designed meaning ...the patterns look like the actual photos. These can be washed and dried and do NOT fall apart. I have thick curly hair and these do NOT get tangled in my hair at all. Will buy more of this style for workouts. Overall pretty inexpensive and a fun gift.
Eternal Matte Lovers Collection ‚Äì 3 Long Lasting, Fast Dry Colors and 1 Nail Treatment, Matte Top Coat ‚Äì 13.5 Fluid Ounces Each | These are cute. Thick polishes, depending on how you paint your nails (thick / thin coat) you may only need 1 layer of this polish. For me, I like to do a single thick coat if possible. This polish allows that with no major issues. I did dry / set using a lamp and found that with base coat and 1 coat of this 120 sec was perfect drying time. (that of course may vary for each person). I do like the matte look this one isn't so flat that it looks like chalk. Overall, nice colors, price point is reasonable for what you get. Polish has lasted over a week with no major chips or peeling.
Beast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast | There is a mild menthol scent to this body wash. What is nice about it, is that it doesn't smell medicated just refreshing. Your body does get a cooling sensation which is perfect to use as an after workout cleansing soap. The scent doesn't linger and this foams nicely when using. Small amount goes a long way. No skin irritations/breakouts when using.
CLAIR BEAUTY Rose Anti Aging Day Cream & Sleep Mask Collection Gift Set - Moisturizing, Firming, Lifting & Rejuvenating | Reduces Wrinkles & Fine Lines | Tones & Smooths Skin | Made in Korea | This is a pretty nice gift set. The scent is mild and doesn't linger all night long. I have had no rashes or breakouts while using and my skin feels very moisturized. The day cream doesn't take long to absorb into the skin and make-up is applied over it without any issues. The sleep mask doesn't leave a tacky / sticky residue either. Overall, this is a nice product.
Sdara Aloe Vera Gel For Face and Body - Organic & Natural, Soothing & Cooling For Sunburn Relief, Restorative For Dry Skin - Made In USA | I don't like that this is advertised as being 100% aloe when it has additives to it like Phenoxyethanol & Xantham Gum just to list a few. I get sometimes having to add preservatives but one of these is listed as a seriously harmful skin care product.<br /><br />Now, if you aren't worried about it. Then Yes, this is a thicker gel like cream. The scent is actually very nice and it goes on smoothly to your skin. The absorption is rather quick and doesn't leave a sticky / tacky coating on your skin. Did not stain clothing and when it did get onto clothing washed out completely.<br /><br />Overall, comes down to what you are comfortable using for YOU which is why I gave it three ...
Magnesium Serum For Kids - All Natural Rub for Kids and Babies, Toxic Free + Free Magnesium Chart PDF | I think it smells nice and it a great idea to calm kids. At first, I this was working great because our little ones were not waking up in the middle of the night. But after about a week, that seemed to stopped.<br /><br /> I have found that using this a couple of times a week is giving us some better results.. Overall, any help is great help.,
TELETIES - Tie Dye Collection - Spiral Hair Coils - Ponytail Holder Hair Ties for Women - Phone Cord Hair Ties - Strong Grip, No Rip, Water Resistant, No Crease Hair Tie Coils - 3 pack (Large, Trippy Hippie) | These are better then average coil hair ties. The plastic coating is smooth throughout the coils and didn't get caught or pull my hair. They are rather large and have a decent amount of stretch to them, you can twist them 2 or 3 times to get a tight hold. Also, again, when removing since the edges are all smooth they didn't get tangled or caught in my hair. While I haven't seen this issue it may come up over time since they are plastic they might loose some of there elasticity over time .
Sunsonic Electric Razor, Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Pop Up Beard Trimmer, Type-C USB Mens Electric Razor. | This is a light weight and pretty great starter shaver for someone. I do like that is arrives with a charge so you can use it right out of the box. You get a charging cable but is is rather short and you do NOT get a wall plug so you will need your own connector.<br /><br />The side open trimmer is easy to open and use as well.<br /><br />My largest issue is the noise level of this shaver. It's about double the volume of other brands I have used. Additionally, I don't know if this would hold up if dropped in water or on the floor. Just a FYI the plastic housing unit feel very thin.<br /><br />Overall, for the price point is a pretty ...
Magic Wand Makeup Brushes Set - 5pcs Wizard Wand Makeup Brushes Foundation Blending Blush Eyeshadow Face Lip Powder Brush Beauty Tools (New-Bronze) | Honestly I was expecting comical plastic brushes. I received die cast heavy well made brushes! The little bag for storage isn't the best quality but the brushes more then make up for the bags issues. Each little wand has some noticeable weight to them. The detailing is impressive and wraps around the entire brush handle. The brushes themselves are somewhat small but that is useful when doing fine details. More then likely these will just be on display more then used. For the price point super amazing gift for any fan of fantasy.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
The Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers bundle is a great deal. You get 22 full sheets of stickers. Each sheet has over 50 stickers as far as I've counted them. They are either multi-colored and halographic or metallic outlined patterns. Every sheet is a little different, so there are no repeats. They apply easily, but I highly recommend doing a base coat first and a coat on top as well. There are also 2 generously filled jars of holographic butterflies that measure 4mm by 4mm at the widest points. This is a really pretty collection of butterflies and I couldn't recommend them more for both the value and variety!
Love it<br />Not expect to many<br />Yahoo!
This set is just mammoth...haha Perfect for anyone who is really into butterflies. And the sticky glue on the back of the butterflies is good enough that they can be used on more then just finger/toe nails, like cell phones, school books, lunch boxes, and places you might rather they didn't start showing up.<br /><br />The collection is widely varied with silver, gold, multi colored, and different sizes and shapes, they are all relatively small to tiny, and there are no tweezers included, not that most folks don't have plenty of pairs lying around...<br /><br />The butterfly stick on nail art is an excellent value and an easy 5 stars.
Overall these stickers are very cute, and they stick on the nail easily. I feel like some of the stickers are very blurry, and it's hard to see what exactly the details are, which is a bit disappointing. The sticker sets also come from different brands, and they have a few different wrappers for each sticker.
It was a lot of stickers for the $ I paid. That was a super blessing
Love it love it. I use them for my customers. She is in love. The package come in 22 sheets with extra 2 small jars of holographic butterflies. Many colors, many styles... *** Make sure you apply base gel coat / hard gel on top, so the stickers last longer.*** I recommended these stickers.

The item description is Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers, 22 Sheets Butterfly Nail Sticker DIY Nail Decals, 2 Set Butterfly Nail Glitter Holographic Stickers Reflected Butterfly Designs for Nails Supply. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: You get so many items in this set.  There are two, hard plastic reusable containers of the silver holographic/ refractive butterfly's.  Then you get a massive amount of sticker sheets.  Not all are the same.  Some are 3d real looking butterflies, some are the moth style with detail work, you get the lace style butterfly shapes (I received various types in Black, Cobalt blue, Gold, and Silver)  plus a ton more.  EACH page or sheet is excellent quality.  By far one of the best collections for this price point in variety I have seen in a long time.

Output: I think it smells nice and it a great idea to calm kids. At first, I was working great because our little ones were not waking up in the middle of the night. But after about a week, that seemed to stop.br />br /> I have found that using this a couple of times a week is giving us some better results.. Overall, any help is great help.

JIADEL Gel Nail Polish Colors Set,Confetti Glitter Gel Nail Polish With No Wipe Base and Top Coat,Soak Off UV LED Nail Art Salon Starter Manicure Kit | This has such nice colors and glitters! There are only about 2-3 regular colors. The rest are glitters and I did notice there were a few that looked like duplicates but will have to see how they apply once in the nail. I love the variety of the set and you don‚Äôt need to do multiple coats. I also like that the bottles have a little clear circle to preview the color!
Soo'AE Sweet Pink Bubble Mask, Clarifying & Softening, 1 Count | Gave this to my daughter. She loved to watch it foam up and get puffy. Can‚Äôt tell if it made a difference in her skin, just wanted something fun for her to do!
CIMIY Gel Nail Polish Set 8 bottles - Manicure Colors Infinity with Top Base Coat for Forest Nail Art Natural Daily All Seasons for Nail Profession Salon and Starter at Home Soak Off UV LED 0.32oz | It‚Äôs a nice set of colors but it‚Äôs so thick to apply that kind of made the application hard but also a pro because you don‚Äôt need multiple coats. Colors were earth toned and very nice.
Yolife Acrylic Nail Brush with100% Pure Kolinsky Sable, Nail Art Brush With Brilliant crystal Handle, for Manicure Pedicure (6#, Silver) | I love the tools this comes with.

It‚Äôs very light on the eyes but definitely adds definition and makes a difference. I like how light the brush is and nicely it applies to the lashes. It does not bleed either!
Biutee Nail Stamping Plates 5pcs Templates With Stamper Scraper Set Nail Art Plates set animal flower Christmas halloween design | This didn‚Äôt work as well as I would have hoped maybe have to practice a few times. I like that it comes with the metal plates with the designs but trying to stamp them they didn‚Äôt always get onto the nail.

My thumb is a size 0 and it‚Äôs so hard to get nails that actually fit which is why I ended up doing my own nails in the first place<br /><br />I‚Äôm so glad they included the same design but in different shapes because I would‚Äôve thrown a fit otherwise when I saw those short ballerina nails.<br /><br />Around the edges of the nails you can see the color fading out where it was printed but that doesn‚Äôt bother me too much

I've used chrome powders in the past and have never been impressed by them. Honestly, I just couldn't achieve a mirrored chrome effect. This set of powders, however, is amazing! With almost no effort at all, I created 4 test nails, with the mirror effect coming through on all of them! I used white at the base color on all my test nails, except for the gold nail that uses a nude base color. These powders are super easy to use, a tiny amount goes a long ways, and the colors are just lovely. A few tricks I discovered: less powder is better than more...if you use to much it get's clumpy and can't be easily fixed. Apply a base coat, a colored base color, AND a ...

Women Facial Razor for Hair Removal - Dermaplaning Tool Peach Fuzz Trimmer Womens Fine Hair Remover Eyebrow Razors and Dermaplane Face Shavers Women's Exfoliating for Sensitive Skin Essential Travel | These are some pretty fantastic razors. They are straight edged, but the provided safety edging prevents me from nicking myself while keeping the blade close to my skin.<br />It removes peach fuzz quickly, efficiently. My skin is super smooth for about a week after use. My makeup goes on like butter, and I am convinced my moisturizers and serums also work better on my dermaplaned skin.<br />They are small and precision enough that I can use them around my eyebrows, though I go slow and don't usually use them for that.<br />But for my upper lip, chin, cheeks and forehead I don't know how I got by before these. While my easy to use electric is nice, these are so much closer. Will be a faithful weekly user!
100 pcs Compressed Facial Mask Women DIY Beauty Facial Cotton Paper Compress Masque Disposable Dry Sheet Mask for Skin Face Care | I wasn't sure what to expect from these compressed facial masks in terms of quality, as reviews were across the board. But, they far exceeded my needs and expectations!<br />They are about the size of three dimes stacked, and are embossed with little flowers on top, which is really just a pretty presentation.<br />They expand easily with moisture, I mixed up my own serum solution with essential oil, and it was easy to soak and unfold. I worried I would have to be super delicate so as not to tear the paper, but these are more of a fabric than tissue.<br />In fact, I opened one up to test it's durability. I used some warm water, added some dish soap and went to town scrubbing my basin. ...
TOUCH IN SOL Flawless Skin Top Coat 1.18 fl.oz. (35ml) - One Step Makeup (Nourishing Ampoule + High Adhesive Makeup Base + Fresh Silky Powder), Moisturizing High Coverage Foundation (#1 Light) | My friend recommended this Touch in Sol Flawless skin top coat, and I am so glad she did.<br />It is really more of a foundation, it has perfect medium coverage. It feels amazing on my skin, light and silky smooth. It leaves me looking matte, but not dry. It's surprisingly radiant.<br />I use it over the Touch in Sol primer, without setting powder, and it easily lasts the whole day.<br />So, here I am recommending it to you! Try it! It's amazing!
The Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine | This is actually a decent palette of eyeshadows. They are not super pigmented, but very easy to work with. This is a very nice beginner palette, especially for the under 10 price.<br />That said, these need a primer. They last an okay amount of time, but will fade quickly if you don‚Äôt use a primer.<br />Simple cardboard container, very similar to colourpop and bh, but doesn‚Äôt have a mirror. Still it‚Äôs sturdy and all the pans arrived unbroken!<br />The shades are arranged nicely, it really has a visual appeal, and makes choosing an eye look easier.<br />It‚Äôs realky not bad, and while my tastes typically run towards the more luxury and pigmented, this is a good entry for a beginner or lighter makeup user.<br />I will be ...
AG Care Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar Leave On Mist | This leave in hair remedy from AG smells wonderful, like a sweet and spicy scent. While it applies strong, it dissipated and left behind a soft clean spicy smell.<br />It worked really well, and was best when I used it after a work out on damp hair vs dry or showered.<br />It‚Äôs a nice product in my easy care hair Arsenal, I will be picking it up again for my gym bag for sure!
30 PCS Blue Hair Care Rollers Hair Curlers Silicone No Clip Hair Style Rollers Soft Magic DIY Curling Hairstyle Tools Hair Accessories | These are an inexpensive and fairly comfortable way to roll my hair at night. It makes getting up and being ready to go in the morning much faster, since all I have to do is unroll, give a spray and shake - and bam waves for days.<br />However, the quality is decent but not great, one of the rollers looked like it was left out side and got chewed on. But, 1 out of 30 (I counted them) is still good odds for the price.<br />They came in the matching clear blue zipper bag, and are easy to store. I'd happily purchase another set.

These Mountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads work great, they're fast at taking off heavy polish and are perfect for traveling by plane.<br /> Each single packet containd a thick moist pad that did all ten of my fingers in no time which I appreciate. These do have a smell but it's to be expected with any strong polish remover.<br /> There are only 10 packets in the box so as far as price goes, these are costly for regular use but if you have a trip planned or you regularly travel these are perfect.
love pads for travel. Have to use 2 for removal of polish, especially dark colors.
I used one pad to take off the two layers of medium dark polish and a top coat from my toenails. It only took one pad to do it all. That will give me 10 uses per box since there are 10 pads total. It seems pricey for what you get. That is why I took it down a star. If you are looking for convenience this worked well for me.
These nail polish remover pads come individually wrapped & there are 10 in the box.<br /><br />They smell just like normal, traditional nail polish remover & we all know what that smells like. Strong!!! As soon as I tore open the packet ... bam. That smell hit me.<br /><br />The actual pads come out of the packet folded in half, have a pinkish color & they seem to be made out of felt or a felt like fabric.<br /><br />I decided to use one to take off my bright Red toenail polish. The first 2 nails came clean but then I started to notice that the remover pad was smearing the polish all over my toes & leaving finger nail polish color on my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, ...

Target: I wasn't expecting to love these nearly as much as I do. Thick, large and easily removes all ten nails worth of polish without making my fingers feel overly dried out like using my regular polish remover.<br />Because they are all individually sealed I can keep one in my bag for any polish removing emergencies, which trust me... they happen.<br />These work fast, I don't know what makes the formula 'advanced' but the process is quick and clean.<br />The smell isn't overwhelming, just the basic remover smell. Works great, travels even better. I'll be keeping these on hand!

Decent gel polish set. Colors are quite pigmented and don‚Äôt require a ton of cotes. This is gel polish and requires curing under a light.
Nice color selection! They work fine but even the darkest shade requires two coats of color at least to be fully opaque! Keep that in mind . Other than that is A good value for your money.
Colors aren‚Äôt that great, thought they were different from the original photo, really only use the red for Christmas
It just peels off. It does not cure and I have an amazing light that‚Äôs works with a ton of brands. I‚Äôve tried every color. They give you a sticker to put the color on half of the color lifted and underneath it isn‚Äôt cured. Last 1 day if even that.
Since we've been quarantined, I've just discovered and started using gel nail polish. I love the variety of colors in this set. I had to use two coats to get the desired color, like with the dark brown. Really nice set!!
This is a good set of gel nail polish. Bottle size is average from other brands I have tried (usually between 6-8 ml), these bottles contain 7.5 ml. Gel is thicker that most brands, which is kind of good and bad at the same time. Good because you can get a great coverage with 2 thin layers. However, it is a little more difficult to apply, especially the white one that is super thick, but you will get a perfect white!<br /><br />Like any other set that does not come with base and top coat, make sure to get them before trying to use this nail polish on its own. They won't last if not using base and top coat.<br /><br />Not a fan of bottles that ...
Manicures and pedicures are a routine event in our home, especially with restrictions on public outings. With younger children, picking nail polish is a given, so despite the gel‚Äôs potential to last for up to two weeks, they manage to remove it in just a few days. For them, though, it means another nail session and new colors, so no big deal. The gel nail polish was hopefully our answer to increase the duration and longevity of their finished nails.<br /><br />Anzuo Gel Nail Polish offers attractive color kits. We received the Kit 3 set, which contains black, red, white, and three shades of tan to brown. Like others have commented, the lids only contain numbers, and the kit includes stickers where the user has to create ...
Great product!!!<br />Last 2-3 weeks on my nails<br />Even though my hands go through a lot as a nurse.<br />Definitely recommend
These took 3 coats to decrease the blotchiness of the first 2 coats, but did eventually go on smooth and blemish-free. The colors are natural looking and pretty, but my manicure chipped after the 3rd day and I had to remove all the polish. Defeats the purpose of a "gel" manicure if you have to take it off after 3 days.

8 Packs 26 Inch Pre-Stretched Braiding Hair Extensions 90g Easy Braid Professional Itch Free Synthetic Fiber Corchet Braids Yaki Texture Hot Water Setting Braids (#1B) | Love this pre stretched hair. It makes braiding my hair way easier. The hair is soft and I didn‚Äôt get tangling. It came with a crochet needle which was a good bonus.
Newcally Eyelashes 25MM Long False Lashes Faux Mink Dramatic Messy Lashes 5 Pairs | I thought these lashes might be too much for me but after trying them out I fell in love. I had to cut them to fit my eyes but they still look good.
Leuxe Facial Cleansing Brush, IPX6 Waterproof Rotating Face Brush for Deep Cleansing, 3 Modes and Smart Timer | I like the size of this brush, it makes it easier to travel with. The shape of the brush also makes it comfortable to hold as I exfoliate. The bristles are soft, I just wish it came with an extra brush head. It exfoliates my face nicely and doesn‚Äôt feel too harsh. It left my face feeling smoother and really clean.
Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion - Superfood Infused Firming Body Lotion with Kale. 6.8 fl.oz, Anti-Aging Moisturizing Lotion For All Skin Types | It smells like perfume. I haven‚Äôt noticed a huge difference with my skin yet but I only have been using it a few days. The lotion isn‚Äôt thick but lightweight and smells so good!
talever Brazilian Body Wave Human Hair Weave 1 Bundle, 100% Virgin Unprocessed Human Hair Weft Natural Color 100g/pc(14) | I was surprised about the quality of this hair. It very soft and silky. I was able to straighten and style this hair with no issues. It was flowy and looks very realistic when I added it to my install. Would recommend!

When you think you‚Äôre being careful by keeping your mouth close while brushing somehow splatter gets somewhere. Then you spit it out and it messes up the skin and walls and mirror. Be prepared to clean! Love the fact that it whitens my teeth and doesn‚Äôt taste bad.
COSYMAY 22'' Curly Wig for Women Natural Black Human Hair Wig Middle Part 13x4'' Lace Front Wig Kinky Curly Deep Wave Brazilian Virgin Remy Hair Wig 1B | The curls in this wig are looser, the wig is nice but the curls are way looser. The wig had a chemical smell too it, something like ammonia. The lace is thin and a bit too dark for my complexion but I think I can tweak it a bit. The wig is also a bit thin.
Workman's Friend Ultimate Hand Care Bundle | My hands are dry and cracked. These products haven‚Äôt made my hands feel softer and moisturized. I was extremely pleased they have a skin cream too. I use the cream on my elbows and other dry patches of skin. I have seen some improvement on my elbows where it isn‚Äôt as rough.

When you read the directions on this, you will see you need a base coat - that is not included in this set. So you will need to use your own base coat for gel nails. Not an issue. Then you apply your black polish, then the glitter. Make sure you use your UV/LED lamp between steps to cure.
I already have a number of gel nail polishes but I love the iridescent glitter of these nail polishes. They are very sparkly and the gel lasts a long time. It's a small set so it will be used up fairly quickly. The only thing I didn't like about it was the strong chemical odor of the polish but it dissipates after awhile. Except for this, I love the look of this nail polish.

Glass Nail File - JORLAI 2PC Nano Nail Shiner Nail Files Polisher Glass Nail Buffers Professional Crystal Manicure Tools Kit for Natural Nails | My sister got a glass file YEARS ago, it broke, so she gave it to me. I've had this thing for almost a decade and wanted something similar.<br /><br />While these are pretty dang close, I have just one tiny complaint. How it curves on the side, can make for tighter and more difficult side files. Like when you have a hangnail on the side of your nail. It works great on the top.<br /><br />I do love the colors, size, and the case. I keep this in my purse for nail emergencies, so it doesn't get the most usage.

Qiray Hair Ties For Women Coil Hair Ties,Large Lace Phnom Penh,5 Colors 10 Pieces. | My girls have been trying different scrunches, and this is by far their favorite. It makes them feel pretty, but also is able to tighten enough in their hair, that it actually holds.<br /><br />I personally, would not wear them as they are not my style, but for a 10-year-old and 7-year-old, they are in love.
NATWAG Reusable Update Makeup Remover Cloths for Sensitive Skin - Microfiber Face Cloth Makeup Remover | Washable Round Makeup Remover Pads | Natural Facial Towels (2 Pads,2 Cloth) (Purple) | They are so soft on my face and don't cause any abrasions when I use them.<br /><br />My face is sensitive and I live in the desert. It's a constant battle over trying to clean my face, but not cause extras stress with making it dry and scratch.<br /><br />I honestly just love feeling them with how soft they are.
Mini Rubber Bands Soft Elastic Bands for Kids Hair Non-slip Rubber Hair Bands Soft Hair Elastics Ties Bands Braids Hair for Girls - STRONG - REUSEABLE (Colorful1000+Black1000) | I really like these a lot. They are easy to open and use on my girl's hair. Even on my hair. Depending on how I put it on, it is sometimes easier to just cut them out instead of reusing them, but you can reuse them.
2020 UPGRADED Exfoliating Loofah Sponge Pads, Natural Luffa Material Loofah Pads Shower Body Scruber for Men/Women Bath Spa and Shower (3 Pack) | Are these super nice luxurious loofahs, you won't get that. But if you want something that does what it needs to do, but may not hold up for a long time. Then that is what you are going to get.<br /><br />You get what you paid for, and I have no complaints.
Facial Cleansing Brush, Sonic Ultrasonic Vibration Facial Brush, Red-light for Deep Cleaning, Discharge Makeup, Gentle Exfoliating, Blackhead Removing, Massaging with 3 Adjustable Modes and Speeds | It is fun to use and feels nice while using it (1-month using the product). However, I haven't seen any benefits to this than the little circle ones that look like this but you use manually.<br /><br />I will continue to use it, and if anything changes, I will update my review. Maybe I just need more time to see a difference.
2PCS Hair Clips Hairpin Headwear Styling Tools Double Layer Twist Plait Tools Hairstyle Hair Twister Clip Multi-Layer Hollow Woven Double Bangs for Knitting Hair | I can not use these on myself and I struggle using these on my girls.<br /><br />Sometimes the clips are really picky. They don't clip, or it feels like too much hair, so you lessen the hair, and then it is not enough hair to hold the clip.<br /><br />I don't know if it is me, or the device itself.<br /><br />I really love the concept, but by the time I put in, to try to get it to work, the simplicity that this product should bring is removed, and I just should have done what works first.

Target: I don't know if it was the batch that I received, but mine were hard to put on. Meaning they had to warm up with the skin before they could smoothly be applied. Before then, they were streaky and patchy.<br /><br />I had hoped for a straight smooth application.<br /><br />Other than that, I have no other complaints about the product. I really love the colors and they work fantastic with my green eyes.<br /><br />I also love the brush at the bottom to help blend and smooth the eyes.

Output: I really like these a lot. They are easy to open and use on my girl's hair. Even on my hair. Depending on how I put it on, it is sometimes easier to just cut them out instead of reusing them, but you are going to get what you are going to get.

Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | This is a nice set of six nail polishes, all in identical black bottles. I assume this is because the polishes are light sensitive and so the black bottles protect all of them from degrading due to harsh lighting. As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would ...
The Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine | This is a gorgeous palette of eyeshadows that range from earth tone colors like sand and tan to red and gold hues characteristic of a sunset (hence the title). Most of them shimmer with glitter, which is really cool - you can mix and match the different colors to get just the right effect. No brush is included but it's easy enough to apply to your eyes with your fingers. The quality is pretty good - I didn't experience any eye irritation when I used this. Very nice gift for yourself or a friend.
CLAIR BEAUTY Hyaluronic & Retinol Day Cream & Facial Serum Collection Gift Set - Hydrating, Rejuvenating & Anti Aging | Reduces Wrinkles & Fine Lines | Locks in Moisture, Smoothing & Evening Skin Tone | Considering it's low price point, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this set performed on my skin. I have dry patches on my cheeks and the moisturizer worked really well at keeping my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I didn't like the eye serum as much (I didn't see much of a difference) but it didn't irritate my skin so both products are decent for the price.
Natural Jade Roller Massager & Rose Quartz Facial Roller 2pcs Gift Set | Jade facial rollers are everywhere these days and it's hard to find one that stands out among the crowded field of rollers. This set contains a beautiful rose pink quarter roller with two tiny bottles containing quartz crystals. I love the bottles but the downside is absolutely no instructions are given as how to use them. If you add essential oils, you usually need a carrier oil (like coconut) because they are not good for your skin if applied directly. I'm not sure how the crystals would mitiate this or not, as they're just little rocks. As a result, I'm not sure how to use these.<br /><br />The roller itself, however, is of good quality and I've been using it frequently. I would get it for the ...
2 in 1 Hair Straightener and Curler Travel Curling Flat Iron Wand Crimper, Dual Voltage 110V-240V Ceramic Tourmaline 1 1/4 inch Portable | I just came back from a trip and packed this curling iron in my luggage. It's described as "travel" but the length is about the same as other curling irons. The main difference is the weight - it's so light and functions as both a straightener and curler, so it does save space in my luggage. It works very well. I had never heard of this brand before but the curler works just as well as more expensive brands. To change from a curler to a straightener, you simply press the buttons "S" for Straightener or "C" for Curling! So simple and easy to use.
Beast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast | This is a strongly scented mens body wash with notes of ginseng, green tea, menthol and Vitamin B. Caffeine is also listed as an ingredient. The menthol and the ginseng scents overpower the rest. It lathers up very well and imparts a cooling sensation that makes you tingle all over and even clears your sinuses! I would recommend this body wash for people with colds because this really helps. I love it.
12ML Refillable Perfume Atomizer Bottle for Travel Spray Scent Pump Case Pack of 5 | This is a multi-colored set of travel perfume atomizers. Each one is shaped like a fancy pen or lip gloss, which makes it easy to mistake it for one. However, each one is quite attractive and adds a touch of glamour to your purse. Each slender tube holds quite a bit of perfume. This is ideal for travel and would make a nice gift for the frequent traveler who can't live without her favorite perfumes.
Vitabrid C12 Vitamin C face brightening powder - 12hours Transdermal, the Best professional Vitamin C complex and LDH help brighten and minimize fine lines/wrinkles through collagen synthesis | This is a small bottle of powder that comes with a tiny spoon. You dab a bit of the white powder into your hand and mix it with your regular moisturizer, which you then apply to your face. I used a little water and my usual Aveeno moisturizer with SPF 15 sunblock. My face does look a little brighter after using it for a week but the effect is somewhat similar to using a light-colored makeup foundation. Unfortunately it has little effect on my crow's-feet or my small &quot;laugh lines&quot;. It's OK but since I can get the same effect applying certain types of makeup or concealers, it's chief benefit is that it's good to use when you don't want to wear makeup and want something that ...
Mountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads with 96% Acetone, for Natural Nails, 10 Count | UPDATED Review:<br />I took off one star because the tips of my nails turned yellow (and stayed that way for a few days) after using this product. Using ordinary nail polish didn't have that effect.<br /><br />Previously:<br />These are convenient for travel but I found that using one pad just isn't enough to remove the nail polish from both hands, especially if you have glitter or gel. When you rip open the packet, the cloth is heavily saturated with nail remover and when you unfold it it's about the size of one of those wet naps you get when you eat greasy food. I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed ...

Can take off even the toughest make-up, even mascara, eyeliner off. It doesn‚Äôt irritate or make your skin red, it‚Äôs lightweight and natural feeling.
Biore Cleansing Oil Makeup Removing Cloths come in a package like most wipes and have a pull tab on the top to open and close the packet. There are 44 wipes in each packet and each wipe is about 4.5 x 5.5 inches (you probably would need 2 or 3 wipes a time if you wear a lot of makeup) and is pre-moisturized. These wipes are to be deposed in the garbage not the toilet and are not to be close to your eyes. Directions state that you should place the cloth on the area that has make-up for about 5 seconds and then wipe off. The scent smells very nice and my skin did feel smooth when done. This product was made in Japan
The Bior√© Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly is slightly like a watery jelly texture and goes on smoothly for washing away dirt and makeup on your face. You simply pump some of the cleaner in the palm of your hand and then massage it gently on your face to clear away the makeup - then rinse your whole face with water. The scent is mild but very nice. When finished you will not feel any sticky residue. I love the guard on the pump that allows you to put it on the pump when you are not using it so little fingers cannot spread the jelly around when you are not looking nor can the pump squirt out when the bottle falls over or when you are ...

The item description is Bior√© J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: The wipes are great but they are on the small side. Depending on how much makeup you wear on a typical day, you'll need at least two to get all your makeup removed. I reserve one for the eyes and one for the face. So I expect I'll use up this package relatively quickly. It doesn't irritate my face and it doesn't leave my skin dry, which is a plus. So it's all good except for the size of the wipes.

Aloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz) | This is a great Aloe Gel. I keep in the fridge and use it regularly. It‚Äôs light enough weight that it doesn‚Äôt feel goopy and washes off clean. Very thick, nice and cold from the fridge and it‚Äôs great for too much sun or too much kitchen (burns, cuts, grease spatters, etc.). Easy to use - no nasty smell and works.
Mens Sea Facial Detox Facial Mask Sheet for Oily Skin- New Skincare - Blackhead, Pore Cleansing, Peel-off (Age under 35) | I wasn't really sure about this and when I first opened it I became even more skeptical. It looked like a paper towel and I had to wet it? Fortunately I thought ahead and opened it before soaking it in water and it was relatively easy to handle. I didn't love wearing it for 30 minutes, I got annoyed by then with the masque but 20 minutes was about my limit and I did see results. I liked the masque overall and it seemed to improve the tone and texture of my skin. I knocked off a point because it was a bit cumbersome to use and waiting around for 30 minutes seemed too much for me. I've got very sensitive skin and this was not of ...
Simply Dana Rivitastore Neck Firming Cream ‚Äî Skin Firming Cream for Tightening Neck, Jawline, and Chest, Collagen Peptides, and Squalane Cream for Wrinkles, Sagging, and Dryness | Seems to work but my neck definitely needs more help than I'll get from a cream. Moisturizes well and absorbs nicely. My sensitive skin didn't have any trouble. I did notice some improvement but it doesn't last through the day.
Face Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape | There are a number of this type of product on the market and this one does not compare favorably to any others that I‚Äôve tried. They don‚Äôt hold well and I didn‚Äôt notice any improvement. I‚Äôll keep shopping.
HWASHIN 12 Pack 3.4oz/100ml Clear Plastic Spray Bottles with White Fine Mist Sprayers for Essential Oils, Perfumes & Aromatherapy (Brush, Funnels, Droppers, Labels & 30ml Measuring Cup Included) | I travel a lot and find that using a mister for a lot of things makes it easier. The problem has always been that the bottles leak or don't mist. These work perfectly and don't leak!
Nail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use | These work okay on natural nails but they don't seem to last as long as some of my older ones that are still in use years later. I generally only use them to touch up rough edges or file down broken nails but I couldn't swear to their durability. I can't imagine them working well on acrylics or gels but since I'm not using either right now I can only attest to the fact that they are working on my natural nails and seem to work okay I'm just not sure about their durability.
Automatic Curling Iron, Rechargeable Cordless Hair Curler with LCD Digital Display and 6 Temperature Settings, Fast Heating Portable Automatic Hair Curler for Styling Hair Anytime ( Pink ) | While I love the idea of this, the actual product just isn't there yet. The charge didn't last long enough to get my hair done (I do have long and thick hair) so YMMV but the second time I tried to use it, it seems that the charge didn't even last as long as the first. Too much trouble for me. I was hoping for a true rechargeable product which would be excellent--if only this one delivered.
JASSINS Face Highlight Stick, JASSINS 3D Dual Contour Stick, Shimmer Cream Powder, 2-in-1 Facial Brightens & Shades Foundation Concealer | Easy to use and blends well. The dark color was a little darker than I would have liked but that's a color issue. The lighter color works well. Does the job.
Gnker Cellulite Remover Massager Brush Hair Mask 5 Seconds to Restore Soft Deep Conditioner Magical Hair Treatment Mask for Dry Damaged | Once I got comfortable using this, the hand part felt weird at first, I've seen decent results. I do use a cellulite gel and this brush and I can really see an improvement. I used the same combination a couple years ago and was very happy with my results but I fell by the wayside - I'm back and I'll continue to use it forever. Between the gel and the brush, the action of using the brush is the most important and I noticed results after a couple of weeks.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
This mask is very soothing. It smells wonderful and leaves my face feeling moisturized and smooth.
This sheet mask was just okay for me. I have sensitive skin and it didn‚Äôt irritate anything. It was moisturizing, however maybe a bit too much for me. It felt like once I removed it that the leftover serum took a while to absorb, even after trying to help pat it in. Maybe in the winter it would be better, but in the humidity here it just seemed a bit heavy and made it difficult for anything else to sink in afterward. The mask itself was a bit bit and not the best fitting, however I didn‚Äôt have any problems with it staying on. I think the value of this product is good for the price. If you have really dry skin you would probably like this better.
I have tried many many face sheet masks. While I did not notice anything special about these ones while using them, I can still think they are a great option because: 1) They are affordable ($2 per mask) and 2) Ingredients are all safe and clean (more details below).<br /><br />I have used them at night, right before bed, usually leave them on for 15 minutes. Once I removed them, my skin feels fresh. The following morning, I feel my face moisturized and soft. There is enough serum to apply on the neck and chest area. There is no need to rinse after using them. Great option to use after a facial. It covers pretty well all face. I had to fold the nose area because of ...
I feel comfortable using these masks every day. They really are mild to the skin but so refreshing. Each mask has more than enough fluid, so much that there is a lot left over to rub on my neck, hands, and arms. Also, the fluid it thicker than water, a tiny feel of a gel, so an hour afterwards, my face still feels moisturized.
Love the way my face feels after this mask - super moisturized, smooth, and velvety. They are unscented as far as I can tell. There‚Äôs a good amount of leftover juice in the packets, which I put on my face after using. It‚Äôs so moisturizing that I don‚Äôt even need to apply face cream until the next day.
I have tried a few products by this company that I didn‚Äôt cere for because of the synthetic fragrance added to their sensitive skin products. This one is the first that did not say it was for sensitive skin, but also has no added fragrance. There is a light scent due to the regular ingredients.<br /><br />I like that this mask helps replenish the skin‚Äôs normal pH level and has good, quality ingredients for moisturizing the skin. Comes with 10 sheet masks you wear for 15-20 minutes and is similar to other Korean sheet masks. What I don‚Äôt like is that the mask is extra wide and covers a lot of my hair area. It also bags more than other masks around the nose area, so I ...
gave this to my sister because she has sensitive skin and literally looking at it the wrong way will make it break out. surprisingly, this product didnt irritate her rather uncontrollable skin. if anything i think it calmed it down a bit. overall, i think this is a great product for sensitive skin.
The smell of these were good but the actual moisturizing didn‚Äôt work as well as I needed it to for my face
I find that some sheet masks don't fit my face very well. This one was pretty good, it didn't feel too small anywhere. The mask also was not very drippy and easier to handle.<br />I greatly enjoyed a few masks so far and plan on using them weekly.<br />Pricing is a little high for me, but I also have some sheet masks in bulk packaging.<br /><br />Cell Fusion C face mask skin care Low pH pHarrier Mask(1box - 10sheets) 25ml / 0.85 fl.oz

Target: My skin is very sensitive so I'm always careful to patch test and then I still can have trouble but this worked fine. Loaded with serum, there is plenty to pat in when the mask comes off. As usual, I had a bit of trouble getting the mask in exactly the right place and had to fiddle with it a bit but once it's in place it stays.

GOGALLJUG Jade Roller and Gua Sha,100% Natural Jade Facial Body Eyes Neck Massager Tool Reduce Wrinkles Aging | This is a nice jade facial roller and Gua Sha. Both ends roll smoothly and the Gua Sha is smooth all around. I do wish the stone itself in both pieces felt even smoother, I can feel slight texture in the stones in some spots (it's just not as smooth as a rose quartz roller and Gua Sha that I have but maybe that's just the nature of the stone itself). Otherwise the stone does feel nice on my face especially when it's taken out of the fridge so it feels cool and refreshing.
BEPHOLAN Facial Skin Massager For Slimming Firming Reduce Wrinkles and Skin Rejuvenate | This is a nice quality rose quartz facial roller. The massaging feature is nice and relaxing. There is a AA battery already installed (I didn't know that until I just happened to turn it on and it started vibrating). I wish the on/off was actually printed or engraved onto the handle. It's just a little gold sticker that could easily fall off if wet or from regular use. To remove/replace the battery you have to turn it to the "on" position and keep turning until the cap comes off. I wish the large roller actually rolled easily. The stone is smooth so it does glide over my skin nicely and with the vibration on, I can't even tell that the stone isn't actually rolling.

BJ√ñRN HALL Button Knotted Nurse Headbands for Women with Buttons | Ear Saver Headband with buttons | Headband with Buttons for Face Mask for Nurses & Doctors | Elastic Hair Band with Buttons | Protect Your Ears with this Headband | Floral Blue | This is a cute twisted knot headband. The button placement is fine for my mask but it could easily be adjusted to your liking with some basic sewing skills. The fabric is soft and stretchy. I would've liked it to be slightly smaller to begin with because it does feel like it will get stretched out too easily with prolonged use. It is a bold pattern but with the mixed colors, it would be easy to coordinate with different scrubs. This definitely helps alleviate discomfort on your ears from wearing facemasks.
BJ√ñRN HALL Nurse Headband with Buttons for Face Mask | Elastic Swimsuit Material, Smooth & Stretchy | Ear Saver Headband with Buttons | Perfect for Nurses, Doctors & Medical Students | This is a nice simple headband that's made out of stretchy swimsuit material. It is single layered so you won't get too warm wearing it. The part that goes behind the back of your head is narrower than the part that goes above your forehead. I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only ...

These are perfect- I love that you can pull them out on the string rather than have to struggle with them being tied tight onto a backpack or something. They are handy for sanitizer on the go for back-to-school!
Very useful for keeping hand sanitizer close at all times.
Los c√≥modos que son lo f√°cil de usar y sobre todo el material perfecto para mis carteras ü§ó
Within a week, one bottle was leaky, and one pull mechanism was broken. It can be clipped to your belt loop without it, but is more awkward to use. Thankfully, since 4 of each item is provided, the rest are still being used. It is nice to always have hand sanitizer available. The bottles are easy to fill.
This was easy to fill with sanitizer and the lid stays securely shut. I keep this hanging off of whatever bag I'm using for the day and am glad to have such easy access to it.
very handy I don't have to carry it in my hand but to know ill always have it in my area to just use and go is a wonderful feeling you can never be to safe out here .
Very useful to have, especially during these times. I purchased half a gallon of hand sanitizer and use these bottles to store them in. Their small size makes it very easy to carry around and the excellent quality ensures absolutely no leakage. I highly recommend these whether it be for carrying around hand sanitizer, or for storing liquids when traveling.

The item description is 4 Pcs Portable Silicone Travel Bottles Keychain Set 1.3oz Empty Hand Sanitizer Bottles Container Leakproof Squeeze Bottles with Flip Cap - Refillable Containers for Toiletries, Shampoo, Liquid ect. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: This is a nice set of 4 silicone travel bottles. They are soft and flexible. I am using them for hand sanitizer but you could use it for anything (like shampoo, body wash, hand soap, etc). So far there has not been any leaks but I wished there was an additional silicone anti-leak flap where the product comes out (like on certain ketchup or honey bottles) so the more liquidy contents doesn't flow right out when you open the cap. I usually turn the bottle cap side up for a few seconds so the contents are away from the cap before I open and then I turn it upside down to squeeze out. I like the retractable clip (it's essentially an identification badge clip or a keychain). Included are small carabiner clips which will allow you to hook the bottle to the retractable clip. It does look a little bulky with that setup but it works. At least you can use all 3 pieces separately if needed and it wasn't made for just one purpose. The bottles and retractable clips are individually packaged and then those items plus the carabiner clips are all packaged into a zip lock bag.

Hairro Curly Ponytail Drawstring 18 Inch #12 Light Brown | It‚Äôs not great, but I also guess it‚Äôs not horrible. It tangles easily and the combs don‚Äôt really have a purpose and pokes you in the scalp. It‚Äôs extremely heavy, & definitely has a synthetic look to it. But maybe add some baby powder or dry shampoo to get rid of the shine?

These milybest lashes are so pretty and give you so many different options and variety has lashes for everyday use and very bold looks they are very long and fluffy and are very good quality I 100% recommend these lashes if you need some cheap but good quality lashes
[[VIDEOID:821cf7aa15b6242e351787591d5b2a64]] The look so nice & came quickly definitely worth the money
These lashes are gorgeous! The lash curl looks similar to lash extensions and the shape flatters my eyes nicely. There‚Äôs a lot of lashes for the price and they‚Äôll last me a minute. I can also reuse them if I clean them right. The lash band is comfortable and my eyes aren‚Äôt weighed down. These lashes make my eyes look lifted.
Love the different variety, nice set. Soft and easy to apply
These are great! The half lash is more natural looking and easier to use and wear. They are a little stiff and don't have much of a curve but if you bend them and work with them a little the curve very nicely.
[[VIDEOID:24aa766d136a416614fec4acad6f4517]] The quality is amazing! The lash hairs are light and fluffy and the length and density is just right. I am sooo obsessed with these! If you need a good lash then look no more!!

It worked great for my beginner skills.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
These are so pretty & very nicely made. The big problem is the horrible toxic chemical odor. These need to off gas outdoors for at least a week. If the weather holds, even longer is better. I let them sit in my hay barn for 2 weeks before using them. They hold my very long straight hair well & do not tangle. They are even packaged in a tidy little round plastic case with a screw top lid. There are 2 of each of five different subtle & soft colors. The smell though, OMG, for that, I wouldn't order these again.
Beautiful hair ties! They are not only pretty and girly but they hold my hair up pretty well and I have very dense hair ! Usually all ponytails fall... with this ones I can have my pony tail for how long I want. They elastic is very good too!
Very pretty, they have a good stretch depending you your hairstyle you may twist twice. You get two of each color. The only thing I did not like is that these hair ties have a paint smell to them so wash them before wearing them.
My wife picked this. There are 10 ties in five colors to match the color of your clothing. They are very cute and feminine. The quality is great. You can find exactly the same ones on eBay, but they are more expensive. So get them here while the price is still low.
Came in with a variety of colors, two ties for each. The quality is great, the pearls were sewn through the fabric, no worry it will fall off. Wear one of them for a week, and so far so good.
My wife loves these. Yes, adults females can wear these casual or dress up. My wife has very thick hair and she can use these to create a ponytail.
Lovely
I really enjoyed having something this pretty to put in my hair. You get two of each color, and they are very pretty. I don‚Äôt have a lot of hair so they were a bit lose on me. With the pearls on them, they really don‚Äôt wrap around too many times and look the same. My daughter put them around her bun in her hair. This accentuated the beauty of the hairpiece, and it worked really well-just an idea for these beautiful hair accessories. They are prettier than the pictures. I‚Äôll be interested to see how long they stay together so I‚Äôll put an update later on how well they last. Very pleased with this product so far, but they are not for people with thin hair.

The item description is Qiray Hair Ties For Women Coil Hair Ties,Large Lace Phnom Penh,5 Colors 10 Pieces. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: These hair ties are too pretty to be hair ties, my daughter actually uses them more as bracelets because their too pretty. She loves the little "pearls" on them. She has worn them in her hair though and she has long semi-thick hair and they work great holding her hair up and together.

Output: Very pleased with this product so far, but they are not for people with thin hair
