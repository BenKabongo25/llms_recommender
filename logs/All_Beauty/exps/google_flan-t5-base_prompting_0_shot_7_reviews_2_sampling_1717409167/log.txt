Natural Waterproof Lash Mascara Black, 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash Mascara Makeup, Lengthening and Thick, No Clumping, Smudge-proof, Long-Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Makeup Kit Eye Lash | This is the best mascara I've ever tried!<br />I have sparse lashes and even with one coat of this mascara, they look dramatically thicker.<br />If I add another coat, I can hardly even believe these are MY eyelashes!<br />With other brands, I've had trouble removing waterproof mascaras, but this one stays on in the pool, but comes right off with my makeup remover wipes. The packaging was cool too. | 5.0
Magnetic eyelashes with eyeliner，Beevila False Eyelashes Upgraded 5D Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit, fake eyelashes 5 Pairs with Tweezers, Easy to Wear,No glue! | When I saw these up for request on the Vine program, I decided to give them a shot. I recently started wearing makeup again, (and now have stopped, because...masks!), and since my eyes are all anyone sees all day, I thought these might look nice. This review is of: Magnetic eyelashes with eyeliner，Beevila False Eyelashes Upgraded 5D Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit, fake eyelashes 5 Pairs with Tweezers, Easy to Wear,No glue!.<br /><br />As I said above, I'm a newbie at these. I have had no other experience with them, so take my opinion with a grain of salt! I played around with these twice. The first time, I couldn't stand how they felt at the outer edges of my eyes. The liner was easy to put ... | 4.0
35.4 Inch Extra Long Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower, 2021 Updated Lengthen Back Scrubber Brush for Men and Women, Exfoliating Back Washer with Wall Hooks, Easy Clean, Comfortable Massage (Green 27.5in) | It seems like I've had an itch in the upper and middle part of my back for months now. It's just so irritating!<br /><br />I requested this product in the hopes it would help me out and it has. I basically use my loofah to apply suds to the scrubby side, then it's just a matter of figuring out where to place your hands so that you reach your trouble areas. I like screaming hot showers, but I know they help to dry out my skin. I can combat that with lotion and loofahs, but it's hard to loofah the center part of your back, you know?<br /><br />The other side of this scrubber is for a massage type feel, but I wasn't digging that as much ... | 4.0
KLAVUU Pure Pearlsation pH Balancing Quick Cleansing Pad 100ea - Powerful Makeup Mild Exfoliating Cleansing Pad without Skin Irritation, Intense Moisturizing | Having recently started wearing makeup again, I found myself in need of a really good makeup remover. That is why I requested KLAVUU Pure Pearlsation pH Balancing Quick Cleansing Pad 100ea - Powerful Makeup Mild Exfoliating Cleansing.<br /><br />What I like most about these pads is their size. They are really big, especially as compared to...almost every other makeup remover pads out there. I mean, they're really big. Also, there's a lot of fluid in this jar. With some pre-moistened pads that I've tried, I've found that they dry out, halfway through the container. What a ripoff, because they're not cheap! With these, there's so much fluid there's extra on the bottom. I have no doubt that the bottom pads will have just as much fluid in ... | 4.0
Facial Cleansing Brush, Sonic Ultrasonic Vibration Facial Brush, Red-light for Deep Cleaning, Discharge Makeup, Gentle Exfoliating, Blackhead Removing, Massaging with 3 Adjustable Modes and Speeds | I wasn't quite sure how to use this facial cleansing brush because the instructions were not clear. However, I came back to the product's site on Amazon and learned more.<br /><br />I love how my face feels after using this brush. I take mine right in the shower with me, and while I'm waiting for my shampoo or conditioner's time to be up, I use my facial cleanser, and use this brush to clean. It's great for removing make-up, (which I rarely wear), and brow liners.<br /><br />Afterwards, even prior to applying serums and/or moisturizers, my face feels refreshed and vibrant. I feel like I'm getting a deeper clean than with my fingertips or washcloths or even make up removal wipes. I also feel like my skin ... | 4.0
Anon Make Up Remover Wipes 100ct | Individually Wrapped Natural Vitamin E and Aloe Vera | Bamboo Mini Makeup Wipes | AirBnB’s Choice for Convenient Single Use Face Wipes | Paraben and Alcohol Free | This review is for: Anon Make Up Remover Wipes 100ct<br /><br />These arrived in a taped and twisted up plastic bag. It was a bit of a bear to even get the darn thing open to access the wipes. Once it's open, you'll probably need to find another container to put all these wipes in.<br /><br />The wipes themselves are individually packaged, which is nice because the ones that come in the package that supposedly reseals but doesn't? Those dry out FAST.<br /><br />These are great if you're going to be traveling and want to toss some in your cosmetic bag without taking up a bunch of room. They're a bit small though and a few times I had to use more than one to get all ... | 3.0
Eyebrow Stencil ,Eyebrows Grooming Stencil Kit Reusable Styling Tool with 1 Eyebrow Pencil (8pcs Eyebrow stencils（new style）) | I’m new to the Vine program and hopefully I’ll be more discerning when requesting items in the future.<br /><br /> As far as I’m concerned this is junk. It’s cheap plastic and flimsy. Look at the directions above, (I assume those are directions, but I’m not positive because I can’t read them), what is even happening there? In the second picture is she thinking? Is she winking? What is going on here? The elastic piece which I thought went around my head was too small and wouldn’t stay on.<br /><br />At this point I dropped a stencil, and because I wasn’t wearing my glasses, (hard to wear them when working on your eyebrows), I promptly stepped on it and broke it. By this time I was so ... | 1.0

Anti Aging Facial Masks by ERH with Intensive Care Serum to Help Reduce the Appearance of Fine Lines and Wrinkles. New Version Exclusive to Amazon with Expanded Mask Coverage. 5-Mask Pack | My daughter and I discovered facial sheet masks over the summer and have become fans of them. They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This ... | 4.0
AuroTrends Makeup Remover Towel,2 Pack Reusable Chemical-free Microfiber Makeup Remover Cloths,Magically and Gently Wipe Away Cosmetics,Sunscreen,Oil and Dirt,Set of 2 (Pink+Black) | I have one of the original Makeup Erasers and to be honest, I can't tell the difference between these cloths or the original one. Well, that's not entirely true, I can tell the difference. These have a hanging loop and the name brand ones don't! Side by side, they are identical. These are just as soft. They do an impressive job of removing makeup, especially mascara. They are gently on my skin. These come in a set of 2, plus the set is half the price of the original. I will be ordering some of these for the girls in my life! | 5.0
BEST Sleep Mask Set - Super Soft Silk Eye Mask For Traveling Insomnia And Meditation + Ear Plugs And Pouch | I sleep better when I wear a sleep mask, so I use them regularly. When I was looking for a new one to replace my worn out one, I was given the opportunity to purchase this one at a discounted price so I could try it out. This is a nice, light weight sleeping mask. I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at ... | 5.0
Pure Rosehip Seed Oil Certified Organic Large 4 Ounce Bottle (120 Ml) By Jarosa Beauty - Cold Pressed, Virgin & Unrefined, Carrier, Face & Hair Oil - No Fillers or Fragrance | First of all, this is a generous amount of rosehip oil! I've been using it daily for about 2 weeks and I've barely put a dent in it. I've been using it on a burn scar that I have on my arm. The pump lid is easy to use & dispenses a nice amount of oil. One pump is enough for my scar. When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears. It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me. I've been keeping it on my nightstand and applying it at bedtime. If it left my hands feeling sticky or greasy, I would ... | 5.0
Scrub Angel Organic Arabica Coffee Body Scrub 8oz. An exfoliator that leaves Skin Smooth and Soft while Reducing Cellulite, 100% Natural Treatment | I love coffee scrubs. This one is a new favorite. There are two types of body scrubs. Dry ones that are like sand and don't clump together or ones that have a lot of oil that cause it to clump together. This one is a dry one. It comes with a little scoop which is nice. My last dry coffee scrub that I had did not, so it actually was a bit messy to use. The directions say to scrub it on your skin and leave for a few seconds before rinsing. Most coffee scrubs that I have tried say to leave it on for a few minutes which I find to be nearly impossible unless you turn the water off. The smell is amazing - a ... | 5.0
Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | My daughter received a UV Light Manicure Light last year for Christmas from her aunt. It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To ... | 4.0
zh-er-0424-dv684 | I am in my late 40's and always looking for new skin care products to help reduce the signs of aging, so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this serum at a discounted price in order to try it out, I was more than happy to do so. It is the first face serum that I have tried that has absolutely no scent or fragrance. It's a very thin consistency, like water. It took a couple of uses to figure out that I can't just pump a little bit on to my finger because it just rolls off. The absorption rate is pretty quick which I like. It's frustrating when you have to wait a few minutes for a serum to absorb into you skin ... | 4.0

Mr. Pristine Organic Beard Conditioner to Grow, Thicken, Moisturize and Protect Your Beard, 8.5 oz. | I would give it 2 stars but I actually like the (opposite) effect it had on my beard. It ended up drying out my beard but gave it a fuller effect. The conditioner itself is a thick lotion like consistency, very hard to squeeze out. Scent is a light spearmint that doesn't transfer to my beard well. Disappears after rinsing. End effect left my beard and face feeling dry and chapped, not what I want from a conditioner. | 3.0
MD Complete Bright & Healthy Vitamin C+ Vitalizing Face Serum| with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Herbal Extracts | Potent Antioxidant Protection, Nourishes, Brightens and Evens Skin 0.5 fl oz | First, the scent is AMAZING...Sweet blood orange with a grapefruit bubble gum undertone, maybe even some jasmine and peppermint, something that awakens your olfactory. Its very strong but not overpowering. Truly one of the best things I've smelt.<br /><br />APPLICATION: Goes on fairly oily and blends pretty well. Immediately brings color to my face, I have medium skin and it starts with an apricot redness but fades back to an awakened tone. I really enjoy that about this, I see others complain about this so maybe it's not best for fair skinned people?.<br /><br />Once dry, I am left with a matte sheen that is well hydrated. You expect it to feel oily but it's more like a raw feel. A really nice balance of hydrated but ... | 5.0
ZOUSZ Black Oud Vegan Beard Balm - Classic Wood-Scented Facial Hair Grooming and Skin Care Butter for Men - Avocado, Argan, Macadamia Oils - Vegan Moisturiser, Conditioner, and Dandruff Remover | If you're a cologne guy, this is more for you...It's strong enough you probably don't have to wear cologne with it. Scent starts off as clean laundry, then comes a little cedar spice, ending with a sweet vanilla...Combined for what I personally wouldn't call "manly" but more of a "man who is trying to smell good"... Has a designer fragrance to it, a little body spray but a bit more classy.<br /><br />Performance is okay. The balm is very fluffy ad soft like coconut butter. It doesn't tame as much as I like but softens and gives a nice glow.<br /><br />Overall I want to hate on this but just can't... I can see why some might hate the cologne smell, it's quite strong and different from ... | 4.0
AZURE Hyaluronic & Retinol Anti Aging Under Eye Pads- Moisturizing & Rejuvenating Eye Mask Patches - Reduces Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Dark Circles & Puffiness - Skin Care Made in Korea - 5 Pairs | Pretty straight forward. Come 2 to a sealed pouch. They are stacked in the pouch so they can be a little difficult to get apart and straightened out. No noticeable or standout scent to them. Apply smooth, nice that they have slits so you can shape it to your contour. They do a nice job refreshing and smoothing my eyes. | 4.0
3 Barrel Curling Iron, 25mm Curling Waver Iron Hair Waver with LCD Display Adjustable Temperature 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Triple Hair Crimper Hair Tools for Deep Waves All Style (1#) | Really nice iron! 5 stars based off of it's value at a $35 price point. Is it a top of the line, 5 star iron? No...But for this price, it is an excellent value for an entry level device. The handle is very ergonomic with an on/off button with +/- temperature control. It heats up quick enough, giving you a temp readout on the LCD display. The iron itself is a little thin and somewhat cheaply painted but it functions nicely. The clasp opens and closes with ease but has good retention. My wife was unsure if she'd like one of these and she is very happy with it and it's results! | 5.0
Automatic Hand Soap/Sanitizer Dispenser Kit - Table liquid Dispenser Pump Station 13.5 oz. Alcohol-Based Sprayer | **update** Unit stopped working after a few days. New (and tested) batteries placed in it and it won't power on. The second part, which is my original review stands true...However, I can not longer give a good rating to a product that lasted a couple days. Your results may vary.<br /><br />Nice little dispenser. Good goldielocks size, not too big, not too small. Doesn't get in the way but doesn't get overlooked. Sanitary design and functions well. | 2.0
10 Magnets Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner, LANKIZ Exclusive 3x Stronger 1mm Ultra-Light Magnets, 5D Magnetic Lashes Pack Natural Look with 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliner Kit & Unique Applicator Tool | My wife is pretty happy with these.

lorelo 20 pieces Hair Curlers, Hair Rollers Spiral Curls Styling Kit No Heat Hair Curlers with Styling Hooks for Girls Woman | I choose these because I've seen these before product curls without the heat and it was as simple as applying them and letting your hair air dry. Well let me tell you it takes alot of practice and patience and knowing what your doing. Is it simple enough to understand, yes. However the sectioning hair, getting tangled, knotted or stuck was alot of the problems I ran into. If my husband had not been home I think I might have been in some real trouble. I'm not mild tempered and almost was pulling my hair out trying to get it unstuck at some points.

Body wave lace front wigs human hair wigs lace front 21”, 4x4 human hair wigs for black women body wave wigs human hair lace front 21” | As we get older, we lose hair and sometimes get thin spots. This is great. It is easy to use and works great. It is very easy to use. You just shake it out of the container. And then you don't see a bunch of skin with nothing on it. Works great and it is easy. And when you shower, it is going to wash out of your hair. And then you are ready for the next time you want to cover thinning areas. Follow all directions. | 4.0

I had my daughter help me put these in. We both watched videos and are still discussing the pros and cons. Now, I am not sure how you are supposed to brush near your scalp with these in, so I will need to watch a video for that too. If I decide not to use them on my head, then I will use them to make a wig for my bjd collectibles. If I do use them on my hair, after the tape has had its full life then I will find something to do with these. They are going to be used, one way or ... | 5.0
BeautyBio GloPRO Attachment Heads | The needles in the eye microtip are not very long and they are very thin, so it is a breeze to go over your eye area and eyebrow area without pain and with ease. I want all of the needling attachment heads. These are the best I have used to date. | 5.0

When I was opening this, I noticed that the cellophane was covering a box that is in a sleeve. The outer sleeve is different in very small ways and looks more costly than the inner box. Anyway, the directions say to apply to clean skin before the night cream. I should see results in 8 days. It went on nicely and it is a nice sized bottle for drops. | 5.0
Gel UV Nail Lamp, AsperX 150W LED Nail Dryer Gel Nail Polish Light Curing Lamp Kit Smart Auto-sensing with 10/30/60/99s Timer | My current gel/uv dryer takes a bit of time to cure my nails. I am trying this one which is 150 watt. Lots of difference than my old one. | 5.0
Biutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED | When you read the directions on this, you will see you need a base coat - that is not included in this set. So you will need to use your own base coat for gel nails. Not an issue. Then you apply your black polish, then the glitter. Make sure you use your UV/LED lamp between steps to cure. | 5.0
Dip Powder Nail Starter Kit 8 Colors Acrylic Dipping Powder System for French Nail Manicure Nail Art Set, Portable Kit for Trave, No LED Nail Lamp Needed… | The girl needs more dip colors, so she will get this set. It comes with eight dip colors, tools for cuticles and for filing, and it also comes with a base coat, an activator, top coat, liquid brush cleaner for the base coat, activator and top coat and a nice nail brush to brush off excess dip powder. . | 5.0
SKINMED Pinklow Make Up Primer Cream Natural Brightening Skin Tone Long Lasting Coverage with Ceramide 3, Peptide and Adenosine 50 ml - 1.69 Ounce | It felt good on my skin. I put it on after I applied Ageless. Then I added a few drops of Angel Skin. I want to make sure I take advantage of all the skin care I can get. This seems to be a good start. | 5.0
PARWIN PRO Pro Hair Straightener Flat Iron 1 Inch - Ceramic Flat Iron for All Hair Styles with PTC Heating Auto Off Salon Hair Ion Straightener for Short Hair Black | I have really come to like the floating plates. I like how it doesn't pull my hair like the standard hair straighteners. I also like that it has ceramic plates with tourmaline. It leaves my hair shiny and feeling good. I only have to play with the temperature gauge so that my thin hair doesn't burn off. | 4.0

JUNOVEM COLE Spirulina Shampoo Spirulina + Aloe Vera, 8.5 fl. oz. Superfood Shampoo For Men & Women, Nutrient-rich hair loving ingredients | This shampoo did the near impossible and managed to dry out my fine, very oily hair. I don't care for it all, because it is way too harsh. | 1.0
Coppertone Kids Clear Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50, Water Resistant Sunscreen for Kids, #1 Pediatrician Recommended Sunscreen Brand, Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50, 5 Fl Oz Tube | This sunscreen is nice. It's clear, absorbs well, and is free of nasty/questionable ingredients. However, it probably isn't best for the face since it leaves a shiny appearance. Still, it's perfect for the body, and my kids loved the blue color. It does go on completely clear. | 4.0
Livordo Moroccan Argan Oil Essential Organic Cold Pressed Skin Moisturizer Rich in Vitamin E Powerful Antioxidants For Skin, Hair, Body, and Face 4 Oz | This is very nice argan oil that comes in a generous 4 oz size. I like applying this directly to my face and body or making my own oil blends. It's very good quality. | 5.0
FULL SPECTRUM BODY OIL, Organic Blend of Marula, Lavender, Cedarwood, Ylang Ylang, MCT Coconut with Vitamin E, for Dry Skin, Scalp, Face, Hands, & Nails for Women MADE FRESH | I love using body oils, but I always end up with oil marks on my clothing. I was drawn to this because it claimed to be ultralight. As it turns out, it is pretty light, but you should wait at least 5 mins before putting on clothing. I accidentally used too much on my legs and had to wipe some of it off. Still, it is 100% natural, comes in a nice package, and smells sweetly of lavender. Would make a nice gift, but don't expect it to sink in immediately. | 3.0
Portable Travel Bottles Set, 3oz Silicone Travel Size Toiletries Containers, Leakproof, Foldable, Squeezable, Refillable, TSA Carry On for Shampoo Lotion Soap cosmetic (Pack of 2) | I am the sort of people who would rather decant my usual beauty products into travel-size containers vs buying sample sizes. These silicone ones are nice, seem like they will last a long time, and best of all they comply with TSA requirements. I am very pleased with these and even use them for my gym bag. | 4.0
Mountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 16 Fluid Ounce | This product does exactly what is supposed to do and takes off all the nailpolish. (It removed mine in just one go which is a plus.) I also like that it comes in a 16 oz. container since that means it will last awhile. | 5.0

Eyebrow Stencil ,Eyebrows Grooming Stencil Kit Reusable Styling Tool with 1 Eyebrow Pencil (8pcs Gray Eyebrow stencils（new style）) | when i first saw these i didn't have much faith. i have bought something like this before that was a waste of money, i hated it so much i got mad -- even though i only paid less than 5 dollrs.<br /><br />this is pretty cool, depending on your preferred shape, you can choose from the stencils they have and load it up to the holder. the stencils are not super stiff, they have some give so you can push them hard against your forehead.<br /><br />this helped me a lot. i have very uneven eyebrows, they take me almost 30 minutes to do just trying to make them look like they are on the same level, one is at the basement and the other one is ... | 4.0
Lesentia Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 31 – Tinted Moisturizer For Face With Spf and Blemish Concealer with All Natural Ingredients like Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and Zinc* (Medium - 2fl oz) | i wanted to like this but i can't. it has coverage like a light coverage foundation but too dark in color, if you are very tan yes the color would work. i can't believe this is a "moisturizer" because it is super thick and sticky, it feels so heavy on the skin, it doesn't set or feel dry after unless you powder it. i can work with the color, i just don't like how this feels, your skin will feel warm and sticky. it's a shame because there is a lot in the bottle. if you want this for the coverage, might as well buy a bottle of foundation. | 3.0
12ML Refillable Perfume Atomizer Bottle for Travel Spray Scent Pump Case Pack of 5 | [[VIDEOID:a3d7f3db939833c254ff74281c0dde18]] with the corona virus thing, i ordered this to fill with alcohol instead. i carry one in all my coat pockets and pocketbooks, so that i can spray my hands. the size is just right. you can't use up a whole thing of alcohol if went out in public. impressed with how pretty they are too. they are easy to figure out. the colors are just jackets -- you pull off the cap and the bottom so that you can unscrew the sprayer and fill it up. very good sprayer as well. not mad. i am happy. | 5.0
Mountain Falls Regular Dip-It Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails, with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 9 Fluid Ounce | i love the convenience and ease of use. just dip your finger in the hole and it erases the polish like it never happened. it is potent stuff. it's basically just remover with a foam soaked inside with a bunch of incisions that you can insert your nails in. no complaints except that you will taste the fume (bitter) when you first open it. just keep it away from nose. | 5.0
BYS Kabuki Brush | It's smaller than expected. I thought it would be bigger because of the price. Is is a very soft brush and good for blending powder and buffing because it's not scratchy, I hate scratchy brushes. It's good to travel with. It also sheds a little bit at first washing. | 3.0

Wonder4 Electric Callus Remover - Rechargeable Electric Foot File Callus Shaver Hard Skin Remover Pedicure Tools with 3 in 1 Roller Heads, for Cracked Heels Calluses and Dead Skin | I have the Amope, which only has one file. This has three, from coarse to fine. But the files are quite a bit narrower than the Amope. I thought this would be a bigger deal, but most of the time only part of the file is being used as I am working on the tough spots like the heel or edge of the toe. It doesn't have a lot of power and it kind of slows down a lot. But it gets the job done. I like that it is rechargeable as the Amore went through a lot of batteries. | 4.0
PARWIN Infrared Flat Iron 1 1/4 Inch Digital Hair Straightener Iron with Ceramic Tourmaline Plate Temperature Control Hair Iron Christmas Gift Black | We have been using this for several months and it hasn't died yet. That shouldn't be a big deal, but there seems to be more and more stuff that doesn't last. It is easy to use and does a good job. | 5.0
Water Flosser Cordless Teeth Cleaner, SOOCAS Professional Oral Irrigator 230ML Portable and Rechargeable Water Dental Flosser with 3 Modes and 4 Jet Tips, IPX7 Waterproof, USB Charged for 30 Days Use | I had never used one of these before, so I didn't realize how much of a mess they can make.<br /><br />First, I saw that the USB charger did not come with a plug. I have plenty, so it wasn't a problem, but it would have been if I hadn't.<br /><br />The plug that covers the USB port is not attached to the unit and I can see it very easily lost.<br /><br />There is no hose. The whole unit needs to be picked up and rotated to use this item. I found it a little cumbersome, especially when I couldn't figure out which button was the off one when I was using it.<br /><br />If you don't get the nozzle in just right it will come ... | 4.0
Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | Well, I do have a setting light. These polishes work fine. I think some of the premium ones, like OPI, work better, and are easier to see what colors are in the bottle. But, for the price they are OK. Gel polish is a pain to use. | 4.0
Wahl Smart Shave Rechargeable lithium ion wet / dry water proof foil shaver for men. Smartshave technology for shaving, trimming, and wet or dry shave with precision ground trimmer blade #7061-900 | My husband is very happy with this razor. I think of Wahl as a hair clipper and probably wouldn't have thought of them when replacing his razor, but I am glad to have learned that they make just as good of a quality razor. He uses a regular razor in the shower, then runs an electric around to catch any missed spots. Because of this the battery doesn't need to be charged very often. The battery life indicator is very helpful as is the razor's ability to charge very quickly. He likes it. He is not raving about it being the best razor ever, but we are both happy with this unit. | 4.0
Neutrogena Fragrance-Free Lightweight Body Oil for Dry Skin, Sheer Moisturizer in Light Sesame Formula, 8.5 fl. oz | The oil itself is great, but to me it smells like suntan oil. I use coconut oil, also scented but very lightly and it dissipates quickly, after a shower. Although I love Neutrogena stuff and use many of their products, I will stick to [[ASIN:B00P8CQK90 Fractionated Coconut Oil - 100% Pure Premium Grade - PUMP + SQUEEZE CAP + FREE Recipe eBook! - BIG 16Oz - Best Carrier Oil & Base For Essential Oils, Aromatherapy & Massage - Great for Roll-On Bottles - Soothing for Skin & Hair!]] | 3.0

YISIBIA Nipple Covers For Women Disposable Self-Adhesive Satin Nipple Stickers Petals Breast Pasties 40 Pairs (light beige) | Review MOST DEFINITELY provided this review:<br /><br />I have used these type of nipple covers in the past and loved them. They come in really handy in the summer with items that are a challenge to wear even with a strapless bra. This pack comes with tons of the covers...some are pedal shaped and some are round, so will last multiple seasons. I tend to reuse mine until they lose their stickiness they don’t smell or anything. | 5.0
Facial Cleansing Brush made with Ultra Hygienic Soft Silicone 4-PACK | These are so fun...I have one at my sink, one in the shower, one in my travel case and an extra. These fine little scrubbers are now replacing using an apricot scrub that is pretty harsh after using these. I highly recommend! The colors are cute too! | 5.0
Travel Bottles for Toiletries, Silicone Travel Size Bottles And Squeezable Containers Holders with belt clip Keychain for Backpack, Shampoo, Liquid, Cosmetic Products(2 oz, 6 Pack) | These are a fun addition to my travel items when it’s safe to travel again. They all came individually wrapped, are squeezeable and a tight seal. Good overall quality. | 5.0
Ice Roller for Face & Eye by Charmlily, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief - Cold Facial Massager Treatment to Reduce Puffy Face & Tighten Pores, Under Eye Wrinkles (Pink) | Review provided by spouse:<br /><br />This is a fun new tool to try. It was bigger than I thought it would be...picture included for reference. Works as intended (don't expect miracles, but overall very good). | 5.0
YinMer Lavish Lash – Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum with Biotin & Natural Growth Peptides for Long, Thick Lashes and Eyebrows | Review provided by spouse:<br /><br />I’m excited to see the results from this growth serum. I over plucked my eyebrows, so hoping to grow a few hairs back in. I will update this post when I have more to share. Very nice packaging! | 5.0
Moyo Natural Labs 9 Piece 2 Oz Premium HDPE Travel Size bottle Reusable Travel Bottle Kit And Travel Jars With Fine Mist Spray Bottle BPA FREE travel accessories for women TSA Approved 2oz 59 ml | This is an excellent set of small travel bottles!<br /><br />They are well constructed, and so far have not leaked a drop. I am confident in using these with any liquids; the last thing you want is leakage, and I do not expect to have any with this set.<br /><br />You get nine vessels to hold liquids with the set: 1 spary bottle, 3 squeeze bottles, and 5 small twist cap bottles.<br /><br />For an inexpensive set, this one really covers all of the bases. Highly recommended! | 5.0

Sam&Helen Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit, 5Pairs Magnetic Eyelashes And 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliners With Eyelash Applicator-No Glue Needed | They ok, not the best lashes.....

Aleavia Restore Soothing Mist – Fragrance-Free Organic & All-Natural Prebiotic, Restorative Spray – Nourish your Healthy Skin Microbiome – 4 oz. | I get "outbreaks" on my hands sometimes. Usually when my hands get bad (even just one hand) I have to apply a cortisone rub a few times a day over a few days to make the redness, flakiness, and itchiness subside.<br /><br />I was hesitant to get this because the ingredients seem pretty simple for something that is supposed to make a difference in psoriasis. Well I am surprised at how effective this spray is. Instead of touching the cortisone rub at all - I just sprayed this on the backs of my hands. Granted I was working form home for the entire day - so I pretty much sprayed it a bunch of times over the course of the day. The redness got MUCH better. And ... | 5.0
YsesoAi 28 Pcs Hair Curlers Spiral Curls No Heat Wave Hair Curlers Styling Kit Spiral Hair Curlers Magic Hair Rollers with 2 Pieces Styling Hooks for Most Kinds of Hairstyles (20 cm/ 7.8 inches) | First off - how these arrive in the bag - like a little roll - is the way they will end up in your hair. There is no way to make them spiral at all. More like standard old school curls.<br /><br />I found them a bit hard to use as well - as I found it a big pain to get the stick through the curler. I ended up squashing like four of five on the stick at a time (since that was the truly painful part) and then using it on my hair one after the other. Plus even though I cut my hair to like shoulder length - these are actually pretty short - just for the ends of your hair really.<br /><br />With ... | 2.0
YanJie Velvet Stretched Button Headband Holder for Nurse Mask Women/Girls/Men 6 Package, Leopard Black Gray Velvet ,Protect your Ear Headband 20inch (Leopard) | These headbands are completely necessary for me to live my life these days. I tried other masks extenders but nothing either stayed put, was comfortable, or actually helped with my mask. I have a few different types of mask headbands now - as I wear one every time I leave my house.<br /><br />These particular ones are pretty nice! If you have a problem with slicker material ones slipping out of your hair - THESE will stay put due to the velour grip on your head. They are not too tight either - some bands I tried squish your brain... The buttons are also the NICEST buttons I have seen on a mask headband like ever. The ONLY flaw with the pretty and matching buttons that are ... | 4.0
Tropical Holistic Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Rose Hip Facial Oil, Anti-Aging Face Oil to Tighten Wrinkles & Lines, Restores Elasticity, Nourishing Hair Oil, 4 oz | I like this oil. With skin care I try to stay as natural as possible. As I have gotten older I also try to stay with pure oils as much as possible.<br /><br />Some people may think rosehip oil will smell like roses. It is not flowery - rather more earthy - more tea like, to me anyway. I like the smell. Kind of fresh and earthy. Not bad at all.<br /><br />This stuff goes on smoothly and easily and absorbs into my skin very nicely. I don't use it during the day under makeup or to work as I have my sunscreen moisturizer routine down pat there. But this is great for the evening or a weekend at home. A little goes a long way as ... | 5.0
Rustic MAKA Natural Deodorant (Baking Soda Free Deodorant for Women & Men, Magnesium Formula, Aluminum-Free, Paraben-Free, Sulfate-Free, Vegan Certified) - 2 Pack BUNDLE (Dream Catcher) | As a vegan who is also allergic to baking soda (hives anyone?), I thought I had found a tag-team deodorant solution at a Green Fest a while back. So I stocked up on both - but then the products crapped out on me. : (<br /><br />I was hesitant to try yet another deodorant as most end up sucking big time and end up in a wasteland... But I did - and I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID! This stuff is AMAZING! It works - it REALLY WORKS!!! And a little goes a long way. I just rub a little under my pits, then I use an old large empty deodorant container that has a large rounded top to really smooth it in under my arms. ... | 5.0
Busy Co. Biodegradable Hydrating Hand Wipes, With Collagen and Peptides to Smooth and Improve Elasticity, 15 Individually Wrapped Wipes (Refresh Line - Fresh Citrus) | While these wipes are very nice plus good for the environment - they are probably not something you will use all the time - only because of their price. I think these are good for one off things - like toting with you when you go camping or hiking or traveling or something. Maybe to keep in the car - just in case (although heat will surely make them dry out).<br /><br />They are unscented - which I love. I hate things that are loaded with perfume. They work well to cleanse a particular area. You can't use them for like a full body thing while camping in deep woods as you would have to use a few to get the job done.<br /><br />Overall very nice ... | 5.0
Rancco Dried Flower Buds Fragrant Petals Ball, 10 Kinds Natural Organic Flowers Ball, Premium Grade Dried Blooming Flower Tea Balls for Tea, Baking or Bath Bombs | First off for anything touting that they are Organic and then come in a non-descript bag - no ingredients, no country of origin or manufacture - no brand info, etc. that is SUPER sketchy. Seriously doubt these are Organic - no marking as such - but there is no info whatsoever anyway - so who knows what is truly in them.<br /><br />I put a ball in my glass mug and poured boiling water anyway. There is no "flowering" like you may get from flowering tea balls. It just sort of filled the entire mug with flowers - petals and flowers. Like the entire mug. It was the consistency of a thick stew. You might get a few sips for the space that is left after the ... | 2.0

3 Pieces Messy Donut Chignons Hair Piece Scrunchies Synthetic Extensions Updo Hair Bun for Women Scrunchies Natural Black #1b | My hair is a 3/4 medium to dark brown with some red undertones. I went with the 1b natural black because the 4 was described as light brown. Light brown is usually a 5. I suggest you go with the number instead of relying on the description. This is still a good product and will match my hair when I first color it... it is always a bit darker. Unfortunately, I was not blessed with thick luscious hair so my buns are super thin (see pictures). This scrunchie is made of synthetic hair and easy to use.

Red Carpet Manicure Starter Kits | I know gel polish has been around for quite some time but I actually switched from dip powder to gel. I do my own nails and just find dip to be messy and time consuming. I figured at this point all gel systems were the same, so I’ve been using a cheap brand. I came across this kit and definitely notice the difference in Red Carpet. It’s much better quality. Your gel polish will last 21 days if you follow the directions.
