Higher Education Skincare: Goal Digger - Silky Moisturizing Cucumber Creme; formulated for dry and sensitive skin; cucumber extract; natural extract: melon, kale, cabbage, ginger, turmeric - 1.7 fl oz | Boy oh boy, does my dry, sensitive skin LOVE LOVE LOVE Higher Education's Goal Digger cucumber creme! This is a wonderful lightweight creme packed with important nutrients such as: cucumber extract, kale, melon, cabbage, ginger and turmeric, to name a few. Together, these ingredients hydrate and soften skin and do so quickly. The creme applies nicely -a little goes a LONG way. My skin absorbs it very rapidly and it does not leave a greasy/oily feeling. It has a nice, light, refreshing cucumber scent. This creme will not make your wrinkles and fine lines vanish entirely but will help visibly reduce them. If you have dry, sensitive skin you're going to want to try this creme. It will do wonders for your skin! | 5.0
Dog Paw Washer Automatic Cleaner for Small and Medium dogs with Brush Pet Foot Cup Silicone | If you're a dog owner, its practically guaranteed at some point, you will have to deal with your dog having dirty, muddy paws. Happens often with our bichon Mac. (Naturally, it recently happened right after I cleaned and mopped the house! lol) I ordered the Mr. Ros automatic cleaner for small/medium dogs. Its very sturdy and durable, not at all flimsy. Its roughly 8"tall and has a removable mat with silicone bristles in the interior which is easily removable for cleaning purposes. The bristles are very soft and not at all hard or sharp. It arrived already charged. A USB cord is included. To operate, simply add water to the washer-(2-3 cups per instructions) Liquid soap may be added as well. (I didn't use soap) Turn the ... | 3.0
Huxley Secret of Sahara Clay Mask Balanced Blend 4.23 fl. oz. | Korean Clay Mask to Refine Pores and Absorb Excess Oil and Sebum | Made with Moroccan Rhassoul Clay | Thanks to dry, sensitive skin, I'm always a bit concerned when trying new skin care products. With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier. It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask. I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job! It applies nice and easy. I let it sit on ... | 5.0
Hemp Lotion for Dry Skin - Soothing Rose Flower & Aloe Hydrate Your Complexion - Non-Greasy, Vegan, 7Oz, 250Mg Hemp, Fragrance & Paraben Free - Guayaquil By La La Leaf | I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy. lol. While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and ... | 5.0
FRESHME Mud Mask - Facial Mask Kaolinite Clay Masks Cleansing and Moisturizing Brightening Smoothing Face Mask, 3.4 fl oz | The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. Because I have sensitive skin that's precisely what I did. I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes. Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a difference after using this mud mask. Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face. In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all. ... | 2.0
EXURE Revitalize with Amla and Argan Oil, 8fl. oz. (240ML) | EXURE is a pretty impressive leave-in conditioner that does a great job of softening and smoothing my hair. Its packed with an impressive array of nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants that protect and heal damaged hair while also adding shine. I don't need to use very much on my shoulder length hair. EXURE has a fabulous scent as well. I don't have any issues with EXURE weighing my hair down or making it look/feel oily or greasy. | 4.0
MU TENUTO Berceuse Water Gel Cream (2.36 fl. oz.) - Hypoallergenic Refreshing & Hydrating Facial Gel Cream with Natural Ingredients, Night Skin Care by Classical Music, Comfortable Lavender Fragrances | I take Melatonin to help me sleep just about every night. I had NO CLUE melatonin helps improve skin condition as well! I have very positive results when I take it to help me sleep. I'm guessing it plays a role in why I experience great results with MU TENUTO Bereceuse Water Gel cream as well! I love the consistency of this cream. Its a nice, light gel. It doesn't take much cream at all to cover my face. It applies/spreads so easily on skin. The first time I used it, I was concerned that it was going to be sticky. Fortunately, that's not the case. It absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft and smooth immediately. I can not only see it but I can feel how ... | 5.0
Foot Peel Mask For Cracked Heels, Dead Skin & Calluses - Make Your Feet Baby Soft & Get a Smooth Skin, Removes & Repairs Rough Heels | My feet are so horribly dry and cracked, they look like funky fish scales. I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help. The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work. Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks). I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed. The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to ... | 5.0

AUGNORYE 13 Pcs Hair Cutting Scissors Kit, Professional Hair Barber Scissors Kit with Thinning Shears, Home Hair Shears for Women, Men, Kids | This barber kit includes scissors, combs, and other items used by barbers. This all fits in a carry bag and would be fine for any amateur or professional hair stylist. The items are good quality and are affordably priced when you purchase them all together in this kit. | 5.0
Wig Head Wig Stands (Purple) | This package includes a pair of scalp massaging brushes along with a stretchable shower cap. The brushes have points with silicone tips so you can safely stimulate your scalp as you wash your head and hair. They feel OK, though not as good as manually massaging your scalp since the brush doesn't have the dexterity of fingers. These are nice to have although I don't expect to rely on them too much. For what is included in this package it seems reasonably priced. | 4.0
Eye Mask Natural Mulberry 100% Silk Super Smooth Sleep Eye Mask for Eye Mask for Puffy Eyes for Dry Eyes for Dark Circles Sleeping Travel While Camping Multi Purpose Men and Women Eye Mask | This eye mask fits comfortably and feels smooth on your face. It functions as desired for blocking out light and helping you relax and sleep. It is not substantially different than other silk eye masks I have tried, while it is not the least expensive option and it doesn't come with any box or bag to store it in. | 4.0
Nail Clipper Set, 19 In 1 Manicure Pedicure Ear Picking Tool Set, Tools For Nail, Cutter Kits, Includes Cuticle Remover with Portable, Nail Tools with Luxurious Travel Case | This is a set of manicure and pedicure tools that includes pretty much all the clippers and instruments you would need to use. These function well and they also have an attractive design that will appeal especially to girls. The case is nice and it matches the tools. This would make a nice gift. | 5.0
Manicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and"Catcher" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack) | This is a basic nail clipping set with a clipper and file. The clipper has a nice look and a smooth cut, with a special material on its edge (feels like silicone) that makes it easy and comfortable to grip. There is a storage case with a snap to close it. If you need these simple nail clipping tools this set is fine, though a bit expensive. | 4.0

QIC 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara, Fiber Mascara, Waterproof Mascara, Natural Thick Thickening and Lengthening Mascara Lasting All Day | (Reviewed by my wife): I was very disappointed in this mascara. It is so messy and goopy. Both steps went on goopy and the mascara kept going all over my face. I do not recommend. | 3.0
Iryasa Under Eye Oil - Dark Circles Under Eye Treatment - Natural Anti Aging Serum for Under Eye Bags Treatment, Puffy Eyes Treatment, Eye Lifting and Firming - Eye Serum for Men & Women - 0.27 fl oz | (Reviewed by my wife): I love the roller applicator of this under eye treatment. It makes applying the product very easy and helps avoid wasting product. The eye treatment smells great and goes on smooth. It moisturizes well and leaves a little shine, reducing the appearance of dark circles and lines. It is not a miracle product, however, and it does not get rid of really dark circles like the ones I have around my eyes. | 4.0
13.5 fl. Oz. Goat Milk Facial Cleanser, Moisturizing Face Wash for Women, Hydrating Natural Face Wash, Anti-aging Face Wash, Face Wash for Aging Ski | (Reviewed by my wife): This is a very interesting cleanser - I've never tried anything like it. It does not foam/lather at all. Instead, it is so thick it has the consistency of lotion. It is gentle but cleans effectively. It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. | 4.0
Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm - Set of 2, 0.25oz - Nourishing Herbal Lip Elixir with 100% Natural and Certified Organic Ingredients | This product is way better than traditional Chapstick. It is very moisturizing and non-waxy. It leaves my lips soft and smooth. The dry lip relief lasts longer than Chapstick. The tangerine scent is heavenly. | 5.0
Lip MOISTURIZER by MERLOTSPF15 - Intense Therapy Lip Moisturizer - Grape Seed Infused - for Healing Dry, Chapped Lips. Made with Beeswax, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E - Color FreeSPF 15 | This is a very nice lip moisturizer. It goes on clear and softens and moisturizes your lips. There is no scent or flavoring. The moisturizer provides sun protection. | 4.0
Way Of Will Sweet Orange Body Wash, Moisturizing Body Wash with Sweet Orange Essential Oil, Body Wash for Women and Men, Paraben and Sulfate Free, 120 mL | (Reviewed by my wife): I did not expect to like this sweet orange essential oil body wash (It's orange!). It smells heavenly. The scent is a mood lifter as described. The body wash leaves my skin soft and smooth.<br /><br />The bottle is surprisingly small, but a little goes a long way. | 5.0
Body Scrubs for Women Premium Organic Nimiah Exfoliating Body Scrub with Activated Bamboo Charcoal Natural Salt Exfoliator Scrubs for Body Foot Hand Skin Care | Pros:<br /><br />*The scrub is really good at exfoliating skin;<br />*After a week of daily use of this scrub, my skin is noticeably softer and brighter;<br />*It is kind of fun to use because it feels/looks like you are rubbing dirt all over your body;<br />*The jar is small but a little goes a long way.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The charcoal scrub is a bit messy if you are not careful. I have to quickly rinse my shower after each use because the stuff has flicked everywhere. | 4.0

Eye Mask Natural Mulberry 100% Silk Super Smooth Sleep Eye Mask for Eye Mask for Puffy Eyes for Dry Eyes for Dark Circles Sleeping Travel While Camping Multi Purpose Men and Women Eye Mask | This mask is very soft and molds itself around my bird beak nose pretty well. I can still detect the tiniest bit of light but it's a lot better than any of my other masks I have for blocking out light. | 4.0
Face Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape | These face lift tapes aren't bad as long as you don't get your hopes up that you will look 20 years younger. I'm nearly 62 and my facial skin is sagging - the reason for me selecting these face lift tapes when they appeared on my list of items I could review. Your skin must be clean, dry and free of any moisturizers. They stick well to my skin and definitely pulls it up some. However, the skin that's pulled up gets crinkled up and if your hair doesn't cover it, the crinkles will show. The tapes are really hard to see once applied, and easy to apply once you get the hang of it. I blew through at least 10 just trying to figure it out ... | 3.0
Mountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 10 Fluid Ounce | I used this nail polish remover today to remove some nail polish that was 3 layers deep and hard dried. I first used a Kleenex and it wasn't abrasive enough so I changed to a paper towel and was able to get the polish off faster. I really can't tell if this nail polish remover is any better than most other brands but it works well enough. | 4.0
Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion - Superfood Infused Firming Body Lotion with Kale. 6.8 fl.oz, Anti-Aging Moisturizing Lotion For All Skin Types | I've reviewed other lotions that were pricey like this one, as of this review this Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion costs $25.90. I think that's kind of expensive because though it's a good moisturizer, it's not a great moisturizer. I can put it on my face, arms and hands and it feels good, but my skin is not as moisturized as some other lotions and creams that I've used. I like the shape of the bottle because I can keep it in the slot in my car door and use it as needed. But, I wouldn't be real thrilled if I paid nearly $26.00 for a 6.8 fl. oz bottle of this lotion and only got an average level of moisturization. | 3.0
Women Facial Razor for Hair Removal - Dermaplaning Tool Peach Fuzz Trimmer Womens Fine Hair Remover Eyebrow Razors and Dermaplane Face Shavers Women's Exfoliating for Sensitive Skin Essential Travel | I've never seen anything like these facial razors before so when they came up on my list of items I could review curiosity got the better of me. That said, they aren't bad. I'm at that age where I might spring an unwanted facial hair or two which I have to remove immediately upon detection. I used (carefully!) one of these small razors to try shaving just a small area of my face and it really did remove all the peach fuzz. I can't say that they are any better than a ladies electric facial shaver I've been using, but these would be a lot easier to carry in my purse just in case I needed to use one. They seem well made and one razor should ... | 4.0
Isshah Stainless Steel Metal Tongue Scraper Cleaner - Get Rid of Bad Breath and Bacteria - Pack of 4 - Eco Friendly Packaging | These tongue scrapers do an excellent job of getting all the yucky stuff off your tongue which is LOADED with bacteria and is the main source of halitosis. I always brush my tongue with a stiff bristled tooth brush, then my teeth with my Sonicare and to finish off the routine I use my tongue scraper to get the last bit of slime off my tongue. I've used a plastic tongue scraper for years and it does real well and so do these metal ones. | 5.0
Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum with Natural Mango Micro-beads, Vitamins E and C, Natural and Organic Plant Extracts, Paraben-Free, 30 ml, Made in France, Phytema | I've used this serum several times and I can't say I noticed any "tightening" or any smoothness occurring. It looks cool in the bottle being gold-ish with sparkles, but it did little to help my face feel moisturized. I have to go over it with a good moisturizer. The little beads rubbed in o.k. but again, nothing really happened. | 3.0
Nail Files and Buffers, TsMADDTs Professional Manicure Tools Kit 8pcs Nail File Set, Sanding Buffer and 100 Grit File Double Surfaces 2 in 1 Nail Tools | These are o.k. nail files, but I wouldn't use the gray side at all as it too rough. I would use the buff side to actually file my nails - if I wanted to use them. I find the thickness of the nail file a little hard to hold and will continue to use my wonderful slim glass nail file and super fine sandpaper to smooth the edges. I play and teach classical guitar and I need my nails to be just right to get good contact with the strings and these nail files leave my nails too rough on the edges. They are well packaged and colorful and would make a nice gift for someone who isn't as fussy as me about their nails. | 3.0

JARGOD 1pcs 100% Kolinsky Sable Acrylic Nails Round Nail Art Brush (size 4) | First this is a real nice pointed top brush. it is well made and very sorry and consistent. The handle is also well made and tight to the brush (no wiggle). Brush cleans up and dries soft and pliable. It is a #4 size which is on the larger size for a lot of nail art. This is probably best for solid designs or applying top coats and not for fine detail or complicated designs. My daughter uses it to apply latex masks and peel off base coats. | 4.0
Pumice Stone for Feet, 2 in 1 Double Sided Hard Skin Callus Remover for Feet,Hands and Body, Exfoliator Pedicure File Block Callus Remover Scrubber (Pack of 4) | These foot stones work ok. They do remove dead skin and calluses but are a bit rough and don't leave a smooth finish. We end up following up with a very smooth foot file. We tried using them in the shower and that seemed to work better so they get 4 stars for shower use but dry they are a bit too rough for our taste. | 4.0
JPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set | I love these wooden combs. They are static free and on a great job of de-tangling the hair. I have issues with static hair and these have solve the problem with the first use. I have shorter hair so I don't even bother with a hairbrush anymore. I really can't evidence which one is my favorite as I tried them all and love them all. I won't go back to a brush or plastic comb ever again as these work amazing, Also the finer tooth ones work great on my beard so that's an added bonus! | 5.0
100 pcs Compressed Facial Mask Women DIY Beauty Facial Cotton Paper Compress Masque Disposable Dry Sheet Mask for Skin Face Care | My grandaughter and her friend love to give each other facials. These are a huge hit as they are having a ball "building" there own face masks. These are the perfect asorbancy for using as a face mask. We made some simple face oil and water masks and the girls loved them. The researched online and came up with a bunch of recipes that they are going to try on the next beauty day. Great effective diy masks. Size is perfect and they are durable and comfortable. . | 5.0
Amtidy Women's Rhinestone Crown Tiara, Bridal Wedding Dance Party Birthday Party Women's Headband Tiara, Queen Tiara With Comb（Silver） | My wife likes these a lot for her workouts. It has been a very hot summer and our workouts have gone from a little sweaty to drenched in sweat grossness. These have not only kept her long hair out of her face, by have stopped the sweat from dripping down her face and into her eyes. Gross yes but they work wonderful and wash up perfectly. Zero complaints. | 5.0
Glass Nail File - JORLAI 2PC Nano Nail Shiner Nail Files Polisher Glass Nail Buffers Professional Crystal Manicure Tools Kit for Natural Nails | If you have never tried a glass nail file do yourself a favor and try these out. Even as A guy I love how these work on my nails. They leave such a smooth finish to your nails and greatly reduced the number of hang nails I get. My girls love these and use them exclusively for all their nail care needs. These come packaged in a padded case so your assured a safe chip free file. These are super quality and should last a lifetime. | 5.0
Pick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material) | This is non metal (i.e. plastic). The tips are curved well but are kind of wide (they don't come to a point) and they flex a lot. It takes very little pressure to get them to flex and as far as using this to scrape your teeth... well you would get almost no scraping. This would be great for introducing kids to what the dentist does or for people with super sensitive gums. I did give 4 stars as it it a good tool for removing paint from delicate surfaces and it is non marring. Handle is comfortable to hold and I actually use this when clean my air guns as the chambers are small and tight and this won't cause damage and can get into the ... | 4.0
TELETIES - Spiral Hair Coils - Ponytail Holder Hair Ties for Women - Phone Cord Hair Ties - Strong Grip, No Rip, Water Resistant, No Crease Hair Tie Coils - 3 pack (Large, Maliblu) | My wife is a big fan of these hair ties. They work well for her longer hair. She generally wears her hair up in some kind of bun and these times work well for keeping everything in place. They stay put but are easy and pain free to remove. Just enough stretch to wrap up the hair. These also work well in conjunction with bobbiepins. | 5.0

zelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, Soft Silicone Mask Holders for Relieve Ear Pain Caused by Mask (Dot) | These are such a great deal. $1.75 a piece which I think is very fair. You get 4 different color silicone ear savers. These stay put and don’t slide around in my hair which is a plus.<br /><br />They’re strong and flexible. They conform to the shape of your head. The masks bands stay put behind the slots. Perfect ear savers that will last forever. Highly recommend these to everyone, so simple to use and so effective in keeping masks stay put! | 5.0
Cutting Scissors Set 10 Pcs Professional Hairdressing Scissors Kit, Hair Cutting Scissors, Thinning Shears, Hair Razor Comb, Clips, Cape, Shears Kit for Home, Salon, Barber | The cape is comfortable and large enough to prevent any hair from falling on me. The case is faux leather and zips open easily. I’m really impressed with the scissors—they’re sharp and heavy. The combs are hard plastic. The clips are metal and durable (they won’t bend). And the cleaning cloth is velvet. Cut my hair beautifully. Very happy with this product. Built to last. | 5.0
BFWood | Love the size and feel of this hairbrush and comb. I’m happy that the bristles are wooden as well and feel nice on my scalp. They’re strong too and haven’t come out yet. The comb is a very thick hard plastic and it’s pointed edges help me part my hair when styling. Very happy with this product!! | 5.0
Pretty Frank Natural Deodorant Jar- No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids – Paraben Sulfate Free Cream Deodorant with Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Jasmine) | Like the size of this jar it comes with a lot of product. Smells like jasmine and it’s all natural ingredients. The paste goes on smooth and it’s very creamy and thick. Helped me stay fresh all day and hid my B.O. very happy with this product!! A little goes a long way. Half a pea size for each armpit was more than enough for me because the product melts into the skin. | 5.0
Bath Pillow for Bathtub, Spa Pillows for Neck Head Shoulders Back Support, Thick Bath Tub Cushion with 6 Suction Cups Men Women Breathable Comfort 4D Air Mesh Quick Dry Headrest Bath Accessories | This pillow is a lot smaller than what I expected. Tried it out and the pillow only covers my head and lower neck area. I was hoping it would have more support but it’s pretty flat.<br /><br />It’s still a good pillow for a smaller tub though. It’s plastic mesh inside so it dries very easily. I think it’s comfortable inside the tub but the size runs smaller than expected. | 3.0
Maya Mari Hydrating Argan Oil Shampoo – Rich in Nutrients, Restores Moisture & Shine, 32 oz | Absolutely love this shampoo. It doesn’t lather like other shampoos but it’s not suppose to. There’s a huge misconception that when a product is super soapy and there’s a lot of bubbles, it’s cleaning. That’s simply not true. You have to read the ingredients to see if those ingredients clean-which this shampoo does.<br /><br />Personally, this shampoo did a great job at cleaning my hair. It took 2 pumps for my hair that’s medium length. It’s a huge bottle that comes with a lot of product. The shampoo itself is thick and clear (no color added). I let my hair air dry and there’s was dramatically less frizz.<br /><br />I was shocked at the results. My hair is soft and shiny after three uses and I love ... | 5.0
2020 UPGRADED Exfoliating Loofah Sponge Pads, Natural Luffa Material Loofah Pads Shower Body Scruber for Men/Women Bath Spa and Shower (3 Pack) | This does a great job exfoliating the skin and it’s a great size. I don’t think it’s too hard or too soft. The fabric side is great to lather up soap. I just flip the elastic band over to use the other side. Convenient to use and great to throw away after it gets old. Very happy with this product! | 5.0
Permanent Hair Removal for Women,Painless Hair Removal device with 500000 flashes ice function,Laser Hair Removal is used for Body Armpits Back Legs Arms Face Bikini Line (Green) | First of all, beautiful design and very easy to use. You plug this in and just shock the hairs away. It’s a little warm after awhile but that’s normal. I’m surprised the sunglasses were actually thick and heavy. Overall, very happy with how many shocks you get out of this product. Will last a long time and definitely worth the price! | 5.0

FUNFLOWERS Headband Wigs for Women, Wavy Long Water Wave Wigs with Adjustable Headwrap Synthetic Natural Black Glueless Machine Made 180% Density 27 Inchs | [[VIDEOID:42a6068f0ee5983e6ebbd51a8e621788]] If you were ever thinking about getting a headband wig I onehundred percent recommend this one.

Winky Lux Orchid Gelee Serum | Skin Brightening Serum | Hydrating Serum with Hyaluronic Acid & Ogliopeptide (30 mL / 1 fl. oz) | I was excited to try this serum because I tried one other skincare product from Winky Lux and I was very impressed. First let's say this packaging is unbelievably beautifully with gorgeous dissolvable orchid petals in the serum. This is a hydrating balancing serum. It makes my skin feel very soft, it works well with my other skincare products and under makeup.<br />Now the ingredient list is a tiny bit disappointing when I look how far down some of the really fantastic ingredients actually are. The real reason I took off a star is because. I personally don't love putting alot of fragrance on my skin. Fragrance (parfum) is listed midway down. The scent I admit is lovely very floral. The scent lasts a long time. So ... | 4.0
Molequle Glow & Go Brightening Mask | I absolutely love a really good brightening mask. This mask feels very good on my skin. It yields very nice results. I'd use this before an occasion where I need to look my best. I used at night at night and it was easy to use. It didn't slide everywhere. I saved all the serum to apply to my skin the next few nights. Yes this is a very good mask. About as good as a $10-$12 mask. Which is a tiny bit pricey for a single mask for the average person. Now as good as it is $26 at time of this review is way too much for this mask. The products great and like another reviewer said if you have the disposable finances then go ... | 4.0
MD Complete Bright & Healthy Vitamin C+ Vitalizing Face Serum| with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Herbal Extracts | Potent Antioxidant Protection, Nourishes, Brightens and Evens Skin 0.5 fl oz | I gave this three stars a neutral rating rather than good or bad. Let me explain why. I was very interested in this product since I always use vitamin C in my regimen I'm always checking out different brands. Plus this one is also a revitalizing oil and I love products that brighten the skin. It's also a cruelty free product. It's a small bottle as you can see from my photo. Has a small dropper which is perfect since you only need a little bit. Now this product directs you to use this first after cleansing your skin before any other serums or creams. It directs 2-6 drops I recommend 2-3 or it'll be too oily. I still had a little trouble when applying my hyaluronic ... | 3.0
Karuna 7 Days of Glow - Face & Eye Mask Variety Pack (7 Sheets), Hydrate, Brighten and Glow | I've tried a couple sheet masks from Karuna before and really liked them. So when I saw this I really wanted to try it. It's a great easy to try a few of their sheet masks. They come in a nice box that opens and closes. Very giftable! Karuna sheet masks are so good I really see results. You recieve seven masks one of which is a pack of undereye patches. I'm really happy with theses. Plus they look lovely on my vanity. | 5.0
Spray Bottle with Adjustable Nozzle, Suream 10.6oz/300ml Green Mist Sprayer with Stream for Curly Hair, Refillable Empty Plastic Bottle for Hairdressing, Planting, Ironing and Cleaning | I wanted to try this because it's the perfect size for what I need it for. I make a formula to spray on my synthetic wigs to make them smell nice and freshen them up between washes. This has a nice even mist spray which is exactly what I need. Plus I love the green. I recommend this bottle if this is the size you're looking for. | 5.0
SAMYANG ABOUTME Red Recipe Super Cleansing Balm 3.04 oz. (90ml) - Soft Melting Milk Texture Makeup Cleansing Balm, Mineral Contained Nourishing & Soothing Cleansing, Rose Scented | I always double cleanse. I first start with either a makeup wipe or micellar water. Then I go in with this. In the past I've tried Farmacy green clean and Pixie's balm cleanser (which is very good). I admit I was skeptical since I hadn't heard of it. I was pleasantly surprised! It gets all the makeup residue off my skin. It has a subtle rose 8scent. If scents bother you it goes away and it its very subtle. I love it. If you're into Korean skincare or are getting into it I recommend trying this. | 5.0
Cotton Headbands 6 Pack Stretch Elastic Yoga Soft and Stretchy Sports Fashion Headband for Teens Women Girls by Kenz Laurenz (6 pc 2" Cotton Headbands-Neutral) | I use one of these every night when I do my skin regimen, they're great for wearing while you do your makeup also. Some are a bit snugger than others but for the most part the elasticity of these is pretty great. Not too tight but not too loose, perfect. They're washable which I love and they're a great price. I took off one star because a couple were tight and needed a little stretching out nothing major just a tiny stretch. Unfortunately that caused the seem to come undone in some areas and will need to be mended. I use one for a while than I put it in the clothes hamper to be washed, while I move on to another. These are basic cotton, comfortable ... | 4.0
Jade Roller and Gua Sha Tools Set - Anti Aging Rose Quartz Roller Massager - 100% Real Natural Jade Roller for Face, Eye, Neck - Beauty Jade Facial Roller for Slimming & Firming | (After using this for a little while I added a star) Read to the end. This product basically fits the price tag. I have recently tried another facial roller from Amazon. Let me start with the benefits of a facial roller. It gets the blood circulating which is supposed to help plump the skin and diminish the look of wrinkles, while trying to keep new ones at bay. Supposed to help smooth out the skin, and help massage some products into your skin.<br />With that said this roller versus any other roller will have these same benefits over time. The real "jade" ones were said to have magical effects for centuries in Asia and used on the skin so that's where that comes in.<br />I personally use ... | 3.0

Avajar Perfect V Lifting Premium Eye Mask 5 Sets(10 Pairs) - Under Eye Collagen Patch | Hydrogel Anti Aging Mask for Puffy Eyes & Bags, Dark Circles and Wrinkles | Elasticity Improvement Pad | I love these easy eye treatments and have used several varients. This is a little dryer than some of the others used and definitely pulls a little more. The results are OK but I think it loses a lot from not having the extra moisture left to dab in when you remove them. Personally I prefer them with a more gel type feel. | 4.0
Magnetic eyelashes with eyeliner，Beevila False Eyelashes Upgraded 5D Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit, fake eyelashes 5 Pairs with Tweezers, Easy to Wear,No glue! | These are great! I am a big fan of the liquid liner over the pens. Super easy to use and you can have professional looking lashes in 2 easy steps. This set has a nice variety of lash styles from every day to super dramatic which is nice. They say reusable - I don't reuse mine because my eyes are super sensitive so can't comment on that part but I have seen that lots of people do reuse them so it is probably personal preference but I couldn't say how many uses you might get out of each pair. | 5.0
AIKIMUSE 10 Piece Nude Matte Pigmented Lipstick Set,Gifts for Women,Velvet Lip Kit Gift Set With Moisturizer Smooth,Waterproof Long Lasting Beauty Cosmetics Makeup Liquid Lipstick Set,8.8 oz | The color on these are strong, but they feel a little waxy for my preference. That being said they do stain quite well and there was a variety of red shades which means there would be something for most skin types. Just not one I can see me using on a regular basis. | 3.0
MILANO COLLECTION TopGrip: No-Slip Comfort Band for Securely Wearing Lace Front Wigs, Wig Grips, Wig Caps & Glueless Wig Bands, Size Small, Beige | I wear a lot of wigs - and am always looking for anything that can make them easier to wear. This product definitely worked, was easy to use, but I am not sure that it is worth the price. I have other items that have worked as well that weren't as expensive. If this was a little cheaper though it would be fabulous for cosplayers that use a lot of different wigs / toppers. | 4.0
Scrunchie Holder Stands with 8 Pack Large Size Scrunchies - Acrylic Hair Ties Organizer for Teenage Girls and VSCO Girls Gift Stuff | I LOVE Scrunchies - I am so excited that they are making a comeback and this is such a fun way to store them. I mean yes it is a little annoying if the one you want happens to be at the bottom - but not really a big deal. I think it's great that this comes with 8 scrunchies already - that in itself pretty much pays for it - but you can add lots more! If you are a scrunchie person then this is for you. I have mine on my dressing table and I love it! | 5.0
Deppex Dry Eye Relief, Eye Mask for Dry Eyes, Moxibustion Eye Pad Deep Conserve The Eye to Alleviate Myopia, Visual Fatigue, Soreness, Swelling - 14 Pairs… (Eye Relief) | In England when I was younger, if your eyes were tired or puffy my mum would always tell me to put used tea bags on them. This is what these patches are like! 15 minutes wear and your eyes really do feel better - especially if you are suffering because of too much screen time. Don't be put off by the fact that the instructions aren't in English. Just take out a new pair, place on closed eyes for 15 minutes, and discard. You won't regret it! | 5.0
MEICOLY 12 Pcs/set Matte Lipstick Set Long Lasting Waterproof Pen Lip Stain Set Halloween | This set is great for anyone possibly looking to try a slightly different look. 12 individual, full size lipsticks all in fall / Halloween type colors. For truer color, as with many lipsticks, several layers work better. The color lasts really well even through eating and drinking, but comes off easily with remover! | 4.0
MOSTORY Glitter Crystal Liquid Eyeshadow Set - 4 Pack Pigmented Liquid Eye shadows Matte Shimmer Metallic Quick Dry Crease Resistant Long Lasting Flake-Proof Blendable Non-Greasy Eye Makeup (4 Pack) | I used the copper and the white/silver to create the effect in the picture. I love that the color was long lastig and definitely shimmery. It didn't flake off as some glitter based ones do. I found the best effect occurred if I let a layer dry and then added more - to build up the shine but if I didn't wait long enough between layers it did get a little clumpy. Overall a fun addition for the holiday / party season. | 4.0

2 in 1 Hair Straightener and Curler Travel Curling Flat Iron Wand Crimper, Dual Voltage 110V-240V Ceramic Tourmaline 1 1/4 inch Portable | Right now, I am loving this combo straightener and curling tool. It heats up to 430 degrees, but it is in Celsius, so look at the conversion for your hair. It heats up very fast. I straightened a piece of hair and then curled it. It did a good job.

STYLEAGAL False Eyelashes - 4 Pairs Multipack Natural 3D False Eyelashes Natural Thick Hand-Made Faux Mink Eyelashes Extension(G106) | These eyelashes are reusable. They are very long and give you a thick and long eyelash look. The lashes are made to last up to 25 times. I am going to be using them on ball jointed resin dolls that need new lashes. If they are too long, you can also trim them for the length of lashes or for the eyelid size. | 5.0

I had my daughter help me put these in. We both watched videos and are still discussing the pros and cons. Now, I am not sure how you are supposed to brush near your scalp with these in, so I will need to watch a video for that too. If I decide not to use them on my head, then I will use them to make a wig for my bjd collectibles. If I do use them on my hair, after the tape has had its full life then I will find something to do with these. They are going to be used, one way or ... | 5.0

What I did, was make a screen print of the instructions so I will know how to use each. When these came in, it was like trying to hold an open bag of potatoes. The packaging was not good and I had these pods falling all over the place. What is in each pod? Got me. Makes my face feel good though. The only ingredients on the selling page is honey, yogurt and sugar. I know there has to be different ingredients for each pod, so that is definitely not right for the ingredients, | 4.0

Aloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz) | As an Aloe Vera product, this gel is OK. Its moisturizing capabilities are below average and its soothing abilities on tender skin are average.<br /><br />The gel leans thin-ish for a "thick" gel. The smell is light and inoffensive.

They are suppose to draw out impurities (charcoal side) and soothe the skin for a "healthier" look.<br /><br />The pads are premoistened and have plenty of moisture. It is easy to discern the charcoal side. After about 3 weeks of use every 3rd day, I cannot see the difference in my skin. I'm not a heavy make-up wearer, so this may be a factor in trying to see noticeable differences when using/not using the Neogen charcoal pad. | 3.0

Can't see using this for toes at all.<br /><br />3-1/2 stars because limited use. Still need to use cotton ball and remove on toes. | 3.0
Yes To Face Wipes for Women and Men, Sensitive Facial Cleansing Wipes for use as a Make Up Remover, Cleaning, Soothing, Cucumbers Aloe Vera (Pack of 2) | These Yes wipes feel equivalent to others on the market & they remove makeup about as well as other makeup removal wipes.<br /><br />I am not a heavy makeup user - very light foundation, powder, a little blush & a little eye shadow. The wipes do not completely remove makeup/residue, so if I use the wipes exclusively, I will get clogged pores within a couple of weeks. This result is the same using other manufacturer's wipes. Consequently, while super convenient especially while traveling, if I travel with make-up wipes, I also travel with blemish cream. | 3.0
Precision Clean Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush | My family has used Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes for years. We end up replacing them after about 3 years or so, but, at a price under $20 each, it still is cheaper than a Sonicare. The replacement head brushes are about the same price as the more expenseive rechargeables, and we purchase them at Sam's and on line. And, in the end, the results are what matter. No one in our family has had a cavity in over 7 years. Some of that has to be the results of a good toothbrushing (especially with my children). | 5.0
