Higher Education Skincare: Goal Digger - Silky Moisturizing Cucumber Creme; formulated for dry and sensitive skin; cucumber extract; natural extract: melon, kale, cabbage, ginger, turmeric - 1.7 fl oz | Boy oh boy, does my dry, sensitive skin LOVE LOVE LOVE Higher Education's Goal Digger cucumber creme! This is a wonderful lightweight creme packed with important nutrients such as: cucumber extract, kale, melon, cabbage, ginger and turmeric, to name a few. Together, these ingredients hydrate and soften skin and do so quickly. The creme applies nicely -a little goes a LONG way. My skin absorbs it very rapidly and it does not leave a greasy/oily feeling. It has a nice, light, refreshing cucumber scent. This creme will not make your wrinkles and fine lines vanish entirely but will help visibly reduce them. If you have dry, sensitive skin you're going to want to try this creme. It will do wonders for your skin!
Dog Paw Washer Automatic Cleaner for Small and Medium dogs with Brush Pet Foot Cup Silicone | If you're a dog owner, its practically guaranteed at some point, you will have to deal with your dog having dirty, muddy paws. Happens often with our bichon Mac. (Naturally, it recently happened right after I cleaned and mopped the house! lol) I ordered the Mr. Ros automatic cleaner for small/medium dogs. Its very sturdy and durable, not at all flimsy. Its roughly 8"tall and has a removable mat with silicone bristles in the interior which is easily removable for cleaning purposes. The bristles are very soft and not at all hard or sharp. It arrived already charged. A USB cord is included. To operate, simply add water to the washer-(2-3 cups per instructions) Liquid soap may be added as well. (I didn't use soap) Turn the ...
Huxley Secret of Sahara Clay Mask Balanced Blend 4.23 fl. oz. | Korean Clay Mask to Refine Pores and Absorb Excess Oil and Sebum | Made with Moroccan Rhassoul Clay | Thanks to dry, sensitive skin, I'm always a bit concerned when trying new skin care products. With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier. It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask. I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job! It applies nice and easy. I let it sit on ...
Hemp Lotion for Dry Skin - Soothing Rose Flower & Aloe Hydrate Your Complexion - Non-Greasy, Vegan, 7Oz, 250Mg Hemp, Fragrance & Paraben Free - Guayaquil By La La Leaf | I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy. lol. While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and ...
FRESHME Mud Mask - Facial Mask Kaolinite Clay Masks Cleansing and Moisturizing Brightening Smoothing Face Mask, 3.4 fl oz | The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. Because I have sensitive skin that's precisely what I did. I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes. Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a difference after using this mud mask. Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face. In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all. ...
EXURE Revitalize with Amla and Argan Oil, 8fl. oz. (240ML) | EXURE is a pretty impressive leave-in conditioner that does a great job of softening and smoothing my hair. Its packed with an impressive array of nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants that protect and heal damaged hair while also adding shine. I don't need to use very much on my shoulder length hair. EXURE has a fabulous scent as well. I don't have any issues with EXURE weighing my hair down or making it look/feel oily or greasy.
MU TENUTO Berceuse Water Gel Cream (2.36 fl. oz.) - Hypoallergenic Refreshing & Hydrating Facial Gel Cream with Natural Ingredients, Night Skin Care by Classical Music, Comfortable Lavender Fragrances | I take Melatonin to help me sleep just about every night. I had NO CLUE melatonin helps improve skin condition as well! I have very positive results when I take it to help me sleep. I'm guessing it plays a role in why I experience great results with MU TENUTO Bereceuse Water Gel cream as well! I love the consistency of this cream. Its a nice, light gel. It doesn't take much cream at all to cover my face. It applies/spreads so easily on skin. The first time I used it, I was concerned that it was going to be sticky. Fortunately, that's not the case. It absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft and smooth immediately. I can not only see it but I can feel how ...

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
This is a great little hairbrush. Its not too big and not too small. It’s made really well. I love that it’s made out of wood; it gives it that earthy aesthetic. It brushes my hair out nicely and it just does the job it’s suppose to!
I bought this brush for my brother-in-law as his hair is very thick and course and he usually breaks brushes that have the backing that comes apart.<br />This brush is really good and sturdy for taking care of thick hair
I like it a lot!! Didn’t find any reviews before I bought it, but it has a very good price. When I receive it, I immediately liked it. This brush is well made and in a perfect size, not too big, so I can put it into my handbag. Very comfortable to brush my hair and makes my scalp feels so good!
Love the size but after using it twice so many of the bristles came out :(

The item description is GAINWELL. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I'm so amazed by boar bristle hairbrushes and how incredible they make hair look and feel.  This GAINWELL boar bristle brush is a wonderful, compact brush. It may be small but it works wonders on our family's hair.  It works through tangles without pulling or causing pain while leaving hair soft, shiny and manageable.  The compact size makes it perfect for travel, to keep in a purse, a school/gym locker, briefcase or even a pocket.  If you've never experienced a boar bristle brush, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. You can't be the price and the results will be worth it!  If, for some reason you're not satisfied, GAINWELL asks you to contact them for assistance. I can't imagine they receive a ton of calls with issues but its great to know customer service is a  priority!

Here are some examples of user reviews for other items, in the format item description | review:
AUGNORYE 13 Pcs Hair Cutting Scissors Kit, Professional Hair Barber Scissors Kit with Thinning Shears, Home Hair Shears for Women, Men, Kids | This barber kit includes scissors, combs, and other items used by barbers. This all fits in a carry bag and would be fine for any amateur or professional hair stylist. The items are good quality and are affordably priced when you purchase them all together in this kit.
Wig Head Wig Stands (Purple) | This package includes a pair of scalp massaging brushes along with a stretchable shower cap. The brushes have points with silicone tips so you can safely stimulate your scalp as you wash your head and hair. They feel OK, though not as good as manually massaging your scalp since the brush doesn't have the dexterity of fingers. These are nice to have although I don't expect to rely on them too much. For what is included in this package it seems reasonably priced.
Eye Mask Natural Mulberry 100% Silk Super Smooth Sleep Eye Mask for Eye Mask for Puffy Eyes for Dry Eyes for Dark Circles Sleeping Travel While Camping Multi Purpose Men and Women Eye Mask | This eye mask fits comfortably and feels smooth on your face. It functions as desired for blocking out light and helping you relax and sleep. It is not substantially different than other silk eye masks I have tried, while it is not the least expensive option and it doesn't come with any box or bag to store it in.
Nail Clipper Set, 19 In 1 Manicure Pedicure Ear Picking Tool Set, Tools For Nail, Cutter Kits, Includes Cuticle Remover with Portable, Nail Tools with Luxurious Travel Case | This is a set of manicure and pedicure tools that includes pretty much all the clippers and instruments you would need to use. These function well and they also have an attractive design that will appeal especially to girls. The case is nice and it matches the tools. This would make a nice gift.
Manicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and"Catcher" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack) | This is a basic nail clipping set with a clipper and file. The clipper has a nice look and a smooth cut, with a special material on its edge (feels like silicone) that makes it easy and comfortable to grip. There is a storage case with a snap to close it. If you need these simple nail clipping tools this set is fine, though a bit expensive.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Nice quality but overpriced. The bottle is quality glass, the sprayer is sturdy with multiple functions, you can spray or stream. It even has nice chalk type labels included. They are perfect if you want to make your own natural cleaning supplies, and the dark amber color will protect your essential oil’s, but I feel that the price is way out of line. I’m not debating the quality, the quality is there. The price… Not.
The glass bottles are GREAT! Very solid, durable and heavy. The spray top, however, is very cheap and flimsy. When you use the bottle you have to hold the bottom of the glass and the nozzle or I feel like the nozzle will break off and the glass will shattered. I’m going to purchase a different nozzle so I can still use the bottle part. Disappointed.
The entire kid moves as you spray it. It screws on tight but where the handle is constantly moves and whatever solution you put in there gets all over your hands.

The item description is Empty Brown Glass Spray Bottles2-Pack, Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist and Stream Settings. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: This package comes with two amber glass bottles that include spray tops. The bottles are wrapped with bubble wrap so they don't crack during transit. The labels are a black color suitable for writing on with liquid chalk markers - so you would need that type of marker, which isn't included with the labels here. These bottles function as intended and are useful if you wish to avoid plastic.

Output: Good quality but overpriced

Embryolisse Eau de Beaute Rosamelis Face Toner, 6.76 Fl Oz | This is great toner. The scent is nice and it leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I love the fabric and how soft it is . It is nice to take off the makeup I love it
The teo small round towels are incredibly soft and gentle, and it really did remove all my makeup with nothing but warm water and some gentle scrubbing. It's incredibly convenient and a great way to reduce waste and save money in the long run. Admittedly, it does take some time to get all makeup off but it's worth it in the end and it feels like a nice, warm facial massage. I actually add a few drops of facial wash to the towel and it removes all my makeup, even around my eyes. Good for my sensitive skin and great for the environment. The larger towel can be used to dry your face, or as a body/face towel. I actually love the larger one for the shower. ...
Oh. My. Gosh. I took off a full beat with waterproof makeup off in like 2 minutes. 2 swipes over each eye with just water and and everything else just came right off the first try. 10/10 would recommend :)

I’m impressed price very reasonable. Highly recommended

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Kind of shocked at how well these are reviewed. First of all, the eyeliner takes forever to dry and it always gets smudged (smudge proof it is not). The eyeliner is barely magnetic and refuses to adhere to the lashes. They fell off when I was out and o was so embarrassed. When I reapplies them, the ends wouldn’t adhere to the liner. It’s a good concept, but I’m sure there are other brands out there that work better than these.
Opened the package and the liner had been slightly open which allowed it to spill out as pictured. Thought I'd try it anyway so cleaned up the bottle and tried them on. Initially I thought they were awesome like 5 stars awesome (minus the whole spilled liner thing), but wore them for a whole day and found the liner would pull up off my lid causing the lashes to go with it, also when I took them off trying to clean them for storage one of the magnets came off that pair. I was super gentle using just a Q-tip with makeup remover on it and still the magnet came off. Will try them again and see if the other pairs are any better.
These are very thick and long eyelashes. The eye liner went on easily and only took a few minutes to dry. It was easy to remove with water and makeup remover.
If you want a longer lashes look without the "whoa! she's wearing lashes" look from everyone who sees you... these are your best bet. Easy to apply and look nice & natural.
It's the second time I have purchased this for my wife. I have to say it's a must have.<br />The lashes looks natural and pretty and my wife is in love! Also I have to mention, it's very easy to wear on. My wife tried them on less than 5 minutes and they just attached so perfectly with little mess and frustration. They are comfortable and will stay all day. Also it's eyeliner and lashes all in one. My wife did end up trimming the lashes a little because she feels they are little long for her.<br />It's a strong recommended to any girls who loves beauty and want something easy to use!
Way to hard to apply. I gave up. After an hour and a half of trying to get them to look decent I decided they were a waste of time and money. Disappointed
Natural looking lashes, not outrageously long. The eyeliner was much easier to apply and smelled better than any other I've tried. Easier to remove as well. I recommend these for everyday wear.
I bought the lashes for my friend. It looks natural and pretty! She loved it very much!

QIC 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara, Fiber Mascara, Waterproof Mascara, Natural Thick Thickening and Lengthening Mascara Lasting All Day | (Reviewed by my wife): I was very disappointed in this mascara. It is so messy and goopy. Both steps went on goopy and the mascara kept going all over my face. I do not recommend.
Iryasa Under Eye Oil - Dark Circles Under Eye Treatment - Natural Anti Aging Serum for Under Eye Bags Treatment, Puffy Eyes Treatment, Eye Lifting and Firming - Eye Serum for Men & Women - 0.27 fl oz | (Reviewed by my wife): I love the roller applicator of this under eye treatment. It makes applying the product very easy and helps avoid wasting product. The eye treatment smells great and goes on smooth. It moisturizes well and leaves a little shine, reducing the appearance of dark circles and lines. It is not a miracle product, however, and it does not get rid of really dark circles like the ones I have around my eyes.
13.5 fl. Oz. Goat Milk Facial Cleanser, Moisturizing Face Wash for Women, Hydrating Natural Face Wash, Anti-aging Face Wash, Face Wash for Aging Ski | (Reviewed by my wife): This is a very interesting cleanser - I've never tried anything like it. It does not foam/lather at all. Instead, it is so thick it has the consistency of lotion. It is gentle but cleans effectively. It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.
Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm - Set of 2, 0.25oz - Nourishing Herbal Lip Elixir with 100% Natural and Certified Organic Ingredients | This product is way better than traditional Chapstick. It is very moisturizing and non-waxy. It leaves my lips soft and smooth. The dry lip relief lasts longer than Chapstick. The tangerine scent is heavenly.
Lip MOISTURIZER by MERLOTSPF15 - Intense Therapy Lip Moisturizer - Grape Seed Infused - for Healing Dry, Chapped Lips. Made with Beeswax, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E - Color FreeSPF 15 | This is a very nice lip moisturizer. It goes on clear and softens and moisturizes your lips. There is no scent or flavoring. The moisturizer provides sun protection.
Way Of Will Sweet Orange Body Wash, Moisturizing Body Wash with Sweet Orange Essential Oil, Body Wash for Women and Men, Paraben and Sulfate Free, 120 mL | (Reviewed by my wife): I did not expect to like this sweet orange essential oil body wash (It's orange!). It smells heavenly. The scent is a mood lifter as described. The body wash leaves my skin soft and smooth.<br /><br />The bottle is surprisingly small, but a little goes a long way.
Body Scrubs for Women Premium Organic Nimiah Exfoliating Body Scrub with Activated Bamboo Charcoal Natural Salt Exfoliator Scrubs for Body Foot Hand Skin Care | Pros:<br /><br />*The scrub is really good at exfoliating skin;<br />*After a week of daily use of this scrub, my skin is noticeably softer and brighter;<br />*It is kind of fun to use because it feels/looks like you are rubbing dirt all over your body;<br />*The jar is small but a little goes a long way.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The charcoal scrub is a bit messy if you are not careful. I have to quickly rinse my shower after each use because the stuff has flicked everywhere.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I have been wanting to try these food peels. I was nervous to try but after reading some of the other reviews I finally did and am glad I did. Followed directions and my feet started to peel the next day. No bad reactions or problems. I didn’t use the included tool. Soaking your feet each day helps with the peeling process.
My feet are so horribly dry and cracked, they look like funky fish scales. I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help. The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work. Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks). I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed. The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to ...
I love these foot masks. My feet are relatively smooth but these help keep them in tip top shape. I make sure to soak my feet for 15-20 mins in warm water before putting the booties on. I put a soak on top of each foot and leave them as long as 2 hours before washing them off. Then starting the next night you have to soak your feet 20 mins each night. This jump starts the peeling. There was a foot razor in the package, which I had always thought you weren't supposed to use with these.
I live in a really dry climate so my skin gets dry and cracked easily. I also like to wear flip flops a lot which makes my feet especially dried out. I used the Baby Feet and two days later the peeling began. I think Im on day four now and they are almost done peeling. My feet already look so much better and feel so much softer. I would definitely use again in the future!
Wow! This foot peel is amazing. My feet are very calloused and dry and this works extremely well. I used this on a Wednesday and by Saturday my feet were starting to peel, by Sunday the were peeling a lot all over. Make sure you’re feet don’t need to be seen for a few days while they are in the peeling stage. It took 3 days for them to finish peeling, but now they look and feel so much better.
Easy to use directions. Within days you begin to see results of your dead calluses starting to peel away. I am eager to watch the results after about 7-10 days of my feet being relieved of dry and dead skin. Doesn’t hurt, nor irritate, just peels away the dead skin on your feet. Effective.
these masks have a very strong herbal smell, which is good, but just a warning. The instructions were fairly simple, but there isn't a clear line for where to cut, and so I ended up cutting the first pair in the wrong spot and was unable to use the sticker to keep it closed. That wasn't the end of the world though. The next day I was able to use my pumice stone and a lot of calluses and dead skin came off, my feet are way smoother than they were prior. Overall I'd recommend them!

Target: (Reviewed by my wife):<br />*Directions are easy-to-follow - just separate the two booties, open up, and place one on each foot.  Tape shut.  Leave on for 60-90 minutes then wash off.<br />*The box says that it should take 1-2 days for peeling to start but my personal experience was that it took 3-4 days for the peeling to start.<br />*At $11.99 for two pairs (you can use the product up to once a month) it's a good deal.<br />*The adhesive did not stick well for me so I put my own socks over the booties and they stayed on fine.<br />*Once the peeling is done my feet are significantly softer and smoother.

Output: Great peels.

First, the scent is AMAZING...Sweet blood orange with a grapefruit bubble gum undertone, maybe even some jasmine and peppermint, something that awakens your olfactory. Its very strong but not overpowering. Truly one of the best things I've smelt.<br /><br />APPLICATION: Goes on fairly oily and blends pretty well. Immediately brings color to my face, I have medium skin and it starts with an apricot redness but fades back to an awakened tone. I really enjoy that about this, I see others complain about this so maybe it's not best for fair skinned people?.<br /><br />Once dry, I am left with a matte sheen that is well hydrated. You expect it to feel oily but it's more like a raw feel. A really nice balance of hydrated but ...
Smells great and a few drops feel amazing.
I gave this three stars a neutral rating rather than good or bad. Let me explain why. I was very interested in this product since I always use vitamin C in my regimen I'm always checking out different brands. Plus this one is also a revitalizing oil and I love products that brighten the skin. It's also a cruelty free product. It's a small bottle as you can see from my photo. Has a small dropper which is perfect since you only need a little bit. Now this product directs you to use this first after cleansing your skin before any other serums or creams. It directs 2-6 drops I recommend 2-3 or it'll be too oily. I still had a little trouble when applying my hyaluronic ...

Target: I was so excited to try out this serum but it irritated my skin. I felt a little burning sensation. And I'm really sad because I really liked the ingredients. It is very oily so it feels like you are applying oil on your face. I did not like that.<br />For oily skin,  I do not recommend it.  It did blend into the skin, so didn't feel that oily after a few minutes but the redness of the irritated area lingered for about 10 minutes.

Eye Mask Natural Mulberry 100% Silk Super Smooth Sleep Eye Mask for Eye Mask for Puffy Eyes for Dry Eyes for Dark Circles Sleeping Travel While Camping Multi Purpose Men and Women Eye Mask | This mask is very soft and molds itself around my bird beak nose pretty well. I can still detect the tiniest bit of light but it's a lot better than any of my other masks I have for blocking out light.
Face Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape | These face lift tapes aren't bad as long as you don't get your hopes up that you will look 20 years younger. I'm nearly 62 and my facial skin is sagging - the reason for me selecting these face lift tapes when they appeared on my list of items I could review. Your skin must be clean, dry and free of any moisturizers. They stick well to my skin and definitely pulls it up some. However, the skin that's pulled up gets crinkled up and if your hair doesn't cover it, the crinkles will show. The tapes are really hard to see once applied, and easy to apply once you get the hang of it. I blew through at least 10 just trying to figure it out ...
Mountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 10 Fluid Ounce | I used this nail polish remover today to remove some nail polish that was 3 layers deep and hard dried. I first used a Kleenex and it wasn't abrasive enough so I changed to a paper towel and was able to get the polish off faster. I really can't tell if this nail polish remover is any better than most other brands but it works well enough.
Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion - Superfood Infused Firming Body Lotion with Kale. 6.8 fl.oz, Anti-Aging Moisturizing Lotion For All Skin Types | I've reviewed other lotions that were pricey like this one, as of this review this Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion costs $25.90. I think that's kind of expensive because though it's a good moisturizer, it's not a great moisturizer. I can put it on my face, arms and hands and it feels good, but my skin is not as moisturized as some other lotions and creams that I've used. I like the shape of the bottle because I can keep it in the slot in my car door and use it as needed. But, I wouldn't be real thrilled if I paid nearly $26.00 for a 6.8 fl. oz bottle of this lotion and only got an average level of moisturization.
Women Facial Razor for Hair Removal - Dermaplaning Tool Peach Fuzz Trimmer Womens Fine Hair Remover Eyebrow Razors and Dermaplane Face Shavers Women's Exfoliating for Sensitive Skin Essential Travel | I've never seen anything like these facial razors before so when they came up on my list of items I could review curiosity got the better of me. That said, they aren't bad. I'm at that age where I might spring an unwanted facial hair or two which I have to remove immediately upon detection. I used (carefully!) one of these small razors to try shaving just a small area of my face and it really did remove all the peach fuzz. I can't say that they are any better than a ladies electric facial shaver I've been using, but these would be a lot easier to carry in my purse just in case I needed to use one. They seem well made and one razor should ...
Isshah Stainless Steel Metal Tongue Scraper Cleaner - Get Rid of Bad Breath and Bacteria - Pack of 4 - Eco Friendly Packaging | These tongue scrapers do an excellent job of getting all the yucky stuff off your tongue which is LOADED with bacteria and is the main source of halitosis. I always brush my tongue with a stiff bristled tooth brush, then my teeth with my Sonicare and to finish off the routine I use my tongue scraper to get the last bit of slime off my tongue. I've used a plastic tongue scraper for years and it does real well and so do these metal ones.
Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum with Natural Mango Micro-beads, Vitamins E and C, Natural and Organic Plant Extracts, Paraben-Free, 30 ml, Made in France, Phytema | I've used this serum several times and I can't say I noticed any "tightening" or any smoothness occurring. It looks cool in the bottle being gold-ish with sparkles, but it did little to help my face feel moisturized. I have to go over it with a good moisturizer. The little beads rubbed in o.k. but again, nothing really happened.
Nail Files and Buffers, TsMADDTs Professional Manicure Tools Kit 8pcs Nail File Set, Sanding Buffer and 100 Grit File Double Surfaces 2 in 1 Nail Tools | These are o.k. nail files, but I wouldn't use the gray side at all as it too rough. I would use the buff side to actually file my nails - if I wanted to use them. I find the thickness of the nail file a little hard to hold and will continue to use my wonderful slim glass nail file and super fine sandpaper to smooth the edges. I play and teach classical guitar and I need my nails to be just right to get good contact with the strings and these nail files leave my nails too rough on the edges. They are well packaged and colorful and would make a nice gift for someone who isn't as fussy as me about their nails.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
My lips get dry during the winter and I need lip balm that is moisturizing. While I use lip balm with sunscreen while outside, I don't like to use lip balm with sunscreen any other time as it usually tastes weird. This lip balm is amazing. It's not too waxy and it doesn't have the odd tastes of those with added sunscreen. In fact, the tangerine flavor is subtle and nice.<br /><br />I love that the ingredients are 100% natural and 65% organic. I normally wouldn't spend more than $5.00 on a tube of lip balm but this is worth it. It's a bigger diameter than the average lip balm size. Plus, the moisturizing ingredients make this a keeper. Glad I got a chance to review this ...
I am a chapstick lover and these are great. I am happy to have a two pack so I have one in my car and one in my house. It is nice and moisturizing.

Target: I pretty much have chronically dry, chapped lips, especially in the winter.  I'm frequently grabbing my lip glosses, balms, and anything greasy that I can put on them.  I find that this Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm is very soothing to my poor lips and really makes them feel so nicely moisturized.  It goes on easily and is clear if I want to use some on the back of my dry hands when I can't find any lotion.  I can't really taste any tangerine flavor, but the scent is definitely there and is very pleasant.

JARGOD 1pcs 100% Kolinsky Sable Acrylic Nails Round Nail Art Brush (size 4) | First this is a real nice pointed top brush. it is well made and very sorry and consistent. The handle is also well made and tight to the brush (no wiggle). Brush cleans up and dries soft and pliable. It is a #4 size which is on the larger size for a lot of nail art. This is probably best for solid designs or applying top coats and not for fine detail or complicated designs. My daughter uses it to apply latex masks and peel off base coats.
Pumice Stone for Feet, 2 in 1 Double Sided Hard Skin Callus Remover for Feet,Hands and Body, Exfoliator Pedicure File Block Callus Remover Scrubber (Pack of 4) | These foot stones work ok. They do remove dead skin and calluses but are a bit rough and don't leave a smooth finish. We end up following up with a very smooth foot file. We tried using them in the shower and that seemed to work better so they get 4 stars for shower use but dry they are a bit too rough for our taste.
JPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set | I love these wooden combs. They are static free and on a great job of de-tangling the hair. I have issues with static hair and these have solve the problem with the first use. I have shorter hair so I don't even bother with a hairbrush anymore. I really can't evidence which one is my favorite as I tried them all and love them all. I won't go back to a brush or plastic comb ever again as these work amazing, Also the finer tooth ones work great on my beard so that's an added bonus!
100 pcs Compressed Facial Mask Women DIY Beauty Facial Cotton Paper Compress Masque Disposable Dry Sheet Mask for Skin Face Care | My grandaughter and her friend love to give each other facials. These are a huge hit as they are having a ball "building" there own face masks. These are the perfect asorbancy for using as a face mask. We made some simple face oil and water masks and the girls loved them. The researched online and came up with a bunch of recipes that they are going to try on the next beauty day. Great effective diy masks. Size is perfect and they are durable and comfortable. .
Amtidy Women's Rhinestone Crown Tiara, Bridal Wedding Dance Party Birthday Party Women's Headband Tiara, Queen Tiara With Comb（Silver） | My wife likes these a lot for her workouts. It has been a very hot summer and our workouts have gone from a little sweaty to drenched in sweat grossness. These have not only kept her long hair out of her face, by have stopped the sweat from dripping down her face and into her eyes. Gross yes but they work wonderful and wash up perfectly. Zero complaints.
Glass Nail File - JORLAI 2PC Nano Nail Shiner Nail Files Polisher Glass Nail Buffers Professional Crystal Manicure Tools Kit for Natural Nails | If you have never tried a glass nail file do yourself a favor and try these out. Even as A guy I love how these work on my nails. They leave such a smooth finish to your nails and greatly reduced the number of hang nails I get. My girls love these and use them exclusively for all their nail care needs. These come packaged in a padded case so your assured a safe chip free file. These are super quality and should last a lifetime.
Pick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material) | This is non metal (i.e. plastic). The tips are curved well but are kind of wide (they don't come to a point) and they flex a lot. It takes very little pressure to get them to flex and as far as using this to scrape your teeth... well you would get almost no scraping. This would be great for introducing kids to what the dentist does or for people with super sensitive gums. I did give 4 stars as it it a good tool for removing paint from delicate surfaces and it is non marring. Handle is comfortable to hold and I actually use this when clean my air guns as the chambers are small and tight and this won't cause damage and can get into the ...
TELETIES - Spiral Hair Coils - Ponytail Holder Hair Ties for Women - Phone Cord Hair Ties - Strong Grip, No Rip, Water Resistant, No Crease Hair Tie Coils - 3 pack (Large, Maliblu) | My wife is a big fan of these hair ties. They work well for her longer hair. She generally wears her hair up in some kind of bun and these times work well for keeping everything in place. They stay put but are easy and pain free to remove. Just enough stretch to wrap up the hair. These also work well in conjunction with bobbiepins.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
These were sent to me relatively quickly and I was excited to use them. But as soon as I checked out the packaging i realized they were expired. They had an expiration date of 05/03/2020 which has clearly already passed. Not very happy.
Great masks!<br />They make my face feel super clean!<br />They are thin and the fragrance isn’t very strong. Really good for weekly relaxation
Every time I find a beauty brand I try going to their websites and learn about their ingredients, where the products are manufactured. I assumed the products were made somewhere in California with USA ingredients. But, I noticed that the product is made in Taiwan. No offense to the country. But, I’ve never used a beauty product manufactured in Taiwan before.<br /><br />I do like the fact that the masks are made without toxic ingredients. Also, mask is okay. But, I wish the company put where the products are manufactured on amazon page. Also, thought that the price was overpriced. 3 product for $18 is too much.
After trying these masks out, here's what I found:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- No fragrance<br />- Very moisturizing<br />- Easily fits big faces<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Cold and slimy<br />- Very drippy<br />- Slightly numbed my skin in a disconcerting way<br />- Gave me breakouts<br />- Kind of pricey (currently $18 for 3)<br /><br />Overall, these weren't the worst. I think that if someone had really dry skin, and warmed these up and wrung them out a little before use, they might be absolutely great for them.

Target: These masks work very good.  Very soothing on the face.  My girls have a beauty day about once a month so we are always trying out new masks.  These ones work great and they loved how clean and soothing these were.  They said their skin felt younger and more elastic.  Super easy to use and no I'll side effects.

Output: a lot of praise.

zelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, Soft Silicone Mask Holders for Relieve Ear Pain Caused by Mask (Dot) | These are such a great deal. $1.75 a piece which I think is very fair. You get 4 different color silicone ear savers. These stay put and don’t slide around in my hair which is a plus.<br /><br />They’re strong and flexible. They conform to the shape of your head. The masks bands stay put behind the slots. Perfect ear savers that will last forever. Highly recommend these to everyone, so simple to use and so effective in keeping masks stay put!
Cutting Scissors Set 10 Pcs Professional Hairdressing Scissors Kit, Hair Cutting Scissors, Thinning Shears, Hair Razor Comb, Clips, Cape, Shears Kit for Home, Salon, Barber | The cape is comfortable and large enough to prevent any hair from falling on me. The case is faux leather and zips open easily. I’m really impressed with the scissors—they’re sharp and heavy. The combs are hard plastic. The clips are metal and durable (they won’t bend). And the cleaning cloth is velvet. Cut my hair beautifully. Very happy with this product. Built to last.
BFWood | Love the size and feel of this hairbrush and comb. I’m happy that the bristles are wooden as well and feel nice on my scalp. They’re strong too and haven’t come out yet. The comb is a very thick hard plastic and it’s pointed edges help me part my hair when styling. Very happy with this product!!
Pretty Frank Natural Deodorant Jar- No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids – Paraben Sulfate Free Cream Deodorant with Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Jasmine) | Like the size of this jar it comes with a lot of product. Smells like jasmine and it’s all natural ingredients. The paste goes on smooth and it’s very creamy and thick. Helped me stay fresh all day and hid my B.O. very happy with this product!! A little goes a long way. Half a pea size for each armpit was more than enough for me because the product melts into the skin.
Bath Pillow for Bathtub, Spa Pillows for Neck Head Shoulders Back Support, Thick Bath Tub Cushion with 6 Suction Cups Men Women Breathable Comfort 4D Air Mesh Quick Dry Headrest Bath Accessories | This pillow is a lot smaller than what I expected. Tried it out and the pillow only covers my head and lower neck area. I was hoping it would have more support but it’s pretty flat.<br /><br />It’s still a good pillow for a smaller tub though. It’s plastic mesh inside so it dries very easily. I think it’s comfortable inside the tub but the size runs smaller than expected.
Maya Mari Hydrating Argan Oil Shampoo – Rich in Nutrients, Restores Moisture & Shine, 32 oz | Absolutely love this shampoo. It doesn’t lather like other shampoos but it’s not suppose to. There’s a huge misconception that when a product is super soapy and there’s a lot of bubbles, it’s cleaning. That’s simply not true. You have to read the ingredients to see if those ingredients clean-which this shampoo does.<br /><br />Personally, this shampoo did a great job at cleaning my hair. It took 2 pumps for my hair that’s medium length. It’s a huge bottle that comes with a lot of product. The shampoo itself is thick and clear (no color added). I let my hair air dry and there’s was dramatically less frizz.<br /><br />I was shocked at the results. My hair is soft and shiny after three uses and I love ...
2020 UPGRADED Exfoliating Loofah Sponge Pads, Natural Luffa Material Loofah Pads Shower Body Scruber for Men/Women Bath Spa and Shower (3 Pack) | This does a great job exfoliating the skin and it’s a great size. I don’t think it’s too hard or too soft. The fabric side is great to lather up soap. I just flip the elastic band over to use the other side. Convenient to use and great to throw away after it gets old. Very happy with this product!
Permanent Hair Removal for Women,Painless Hair Removal device with 500000 flashes ice function,Laser Hair Removal is used for Body Armpits Back Legs Arms Face Bikini Line (Green) | First of all, beautiful design and very easy to use. You plug this in and just shock the hairs away. It’s a little warm after awhile but that’s normal. I’m surprised the sunglasses were actually thick and heavy. Overall, very happy with how many shocks you get out of this product. Will last a long time and definitely worth the price!

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Overall, this is a pretty decent kit if you want to forgo a trip to the salon. It has all of the products you need to complete your lash perm, however there is a bit of a learning curve to it. Once you get the hang of it however, it goes pretty smoothly. I myself have used several different kits, and this one ranks in my top 5. The results were pretty good and there was noticeable lifting of my lashes. I estimate I will be able to get roughly 3 perms out of this kit in total which is pretty good, especially considering the price. It says it can last upwards of 4 weeks, but I guess only time will tell how long the perm actually ...
This is my 3rd time purchasing this perming kit. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that you only receive enough product to do 2 permings, and if you don't carefully and quickly seal the bottles of solutions back up with the little rubber stoppers along with the lids the product will go bad and will not be good for a 2nd use. That has been my experience each time with this product. I continue to purchase it because it does work effectively the first time and even if I only get one use out of it, at this price I am still getting my lashes permed cheaper than going to a salon. The perm lasts on me for about 8 weeks.
DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I had really high hopes for this product. When I received it, the pads to put on your eyelids do not fit. they are extremely too big, even the small ones. Then, when I tried to apply the glue to my lashes it just weighed them down and did not stick at all, so when I went to put the perm on all of it got into my lashes and eyes and started to burn super bad. not even sure what products are in this so i hope nothing happens to my eyes. my advice would just to get your eyelashes professionally done. Because all the time and hassle I wasted trying to use this product I could have had someone else do ...
I liked that this lash lift gave MULTIPLE options for how curled you wanted your lashes. I will say the lashes need more time in the perm section than what is mentioned. If I stick to the original time, my lashes barely curl. Overall, I like it!
The eyelash glue sucks. If it actually made the pad or eyelash stop th iui s product might actually work
Used to laminate brows-Works! Instructions are not great but there are plenty of tutorials to help. Didn't irritate or cause redness

Target: They come labeled in steps. It’s easier to watch the video instead of the instructions. I recommend doing one eye at a time if doing it on yourself. Smaller lift pads allow you to get a tighter curl. Larger pad means looser curl. This kit works! Wish they had stronger eyelash glue—always takes me a lot of swipes to keep lash on the pad so I use my own eyelash glue. Otherwise, wonderful product!!

Output: Great for my skin.

When I opened this comb I thought the color was so cute and I loved the metal end. But the first time I used it while flat ironing my hair, the bristles melted. Great come to use for parting but probably should keep away from heat.
Sturdy plastic and metal. Made well. Came quickly and was packaged with care. Great for the price! Recommend!
This is just ok, not great quality at all.
Perfect rat comb for parting hair for braids. Works to give great precision.
The comb is great for parting. Exactly what I needed it for but it is kinda cheap so could easily break if too rough. Good as a temporary comb
Great comb for helping to separate hair for braids. Have been using the same old black one for years. This seemed like a simply way to brighten the mornings up.
Just what I needed for parting my daughter’s hair for dance. Simple and works well.
This is a nice rat tail comb . The plastic is thin but this comb gets the job done. I wanted to try this comb so I can make straighter parts when I'm styling my granddaughters hair. I definitely recommend this product.

First let's say this packaging is unbelievably beautifully with gorgeous dissolvable orchid petals in the serum. This is a hydrating balancing serum. It makes my skin feel very soft, it works well with my other skincare products and under makeup.<br />Now the ingredient list is a tiny bit disappointing when I look how far down some of the really fantastic ingredients actually are. The real reason I took off a star is because. I personally don't love putting alot of fragrance on my skin. Fragrance (parfum) is listed midway down. The scent I admit is lovely very floral. The scent lasts a long time. So ...
Molequle Glow & Go Brightening Mask | I absolutely love a really good brightening mask. This mask feels very good on my skin. It yields very nice results. I'd use this before an occasion where I need to look my best. I used at night at night and it was easy to use. It didn't slide everywhere. I saved all the serum to apply to my skin the next few nights. Yes this is a very good mask. About as good as a $10-$12 mask. Which is a tiny bit pricey for a single mask for the average person. Now as good as it is $26 at time of this review is way too much for this mask. The products great and like another reviewer said if you have the disposable finances then go ...
MD Complete Bright & Healthy Vitamin C+ Vitalizing Face Serum| with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Herbal Extracts | Potent Antioxidant Protection, Nourishes, Brightens and Evens Skin 0.5 fl oz | I gave this three stars a neutral rating rather than good or bad. Let me explain why. I was very interested in this product since I always use vitamin C in my regimen I'm always checking out different brands. Plus this one is also a revitalizing oil and I love products that brighten the skin. It's also a cruelty free product. It's a small bottle as you can see from my photo. Has a small dropper which is perfect since you only need a little bit. Now this product directs you to use this first after cleansing your skin before any other serums or creams. It directs 2-6 drops I recommend 2-3 or it'll be too oily. I still had a little trouble when applying my hyaluronic ...
Karuna 7 Days of Glow - Face & Eye Mask Variety Pack (7 Sheets), Hydrate, Brighten and Glow | I've tried a couple sheet masks from Karuna before and really liked them. So when I saw this I really wanted to try it. It's a great easy to try a few of their sheet masks. They come in a nice box that opens and closes. Very giftable! Karuna sheet masks are so good I really see results. You recieve seven masks one of which is a pack of undereye patches. I'm really happy with theses. Plus they look lovely on my vanity.
Spray Bottle with Adjustable Nozzle, Suream 10.6oz/300ml Green Mist Sprayer with Stream for Curly Hair, Refillable Empty Plastic Bottle for Hairdressing, Planting, Ironing and Cleaning | I wanted to try this because it's the perfect size for what I need it for. I make a formula to spray on my synthetic wigs to make them smell nice and freshen them up between washes. This has a nice even mist spray which is exactly what I need. Plus I love the green. I recommend this bottle if this is the size you're looking for.
SAMYANG ABOUTME Red Recipe Super Cleansing Balm 3.04 oz. (90ml) - Soft Melting Milk Texture Makeup Cleansing Balm, Mineral Contained Nourishing & Soothing Cleansing, Rose Scented | I always double cleanse. I first start with either a makeup wipe or micellar water. Then I go in with this. In the past I've tried Farmacy green clean and Pixie's balm cleanser (which is very good). I admit I was skeptical since I hadn't heard of it. I was pleasantly surprised! It gets all the makeup residue off my skin. It has a subtle rose 8scent. If scents bother you it goes away and it its very subtle. I love it. If you're into Korean skincare or are getting into it I recommend trying this.
Cotton Headbands 6 Pack Stretch Elastic Yoga Soft and Stretchy Sports Fashion Headband for Teens Women Girls by Kenz Laurenz (6 pc 2" Cotton Headbands-Neutral) | I use one of these every night when I do my skin regimen, they're great for wearing while you do your makeup also. Some are a bit snugger than others but for the most part the elasticity of these is pretty great. Not too tight but not too loose, perfect. They're washable which I love and they're a great price. I took off one star because a couple were tight and needed a little stretching out nothing major just a tiny stretch. Unfortunately that caused the seem to come undone in some areas and will need to be mended. I use one for a while than I put it in the clothes hamper to be washed, while I move on to another. These are basic cotton, comfortable ...
Jade Roller and Gua Sha Tools Set - Anti Aging Rose Quartz Roller Massager - 100% Real Natural Jade Roller for Face, Eye, Neck - Beauty Jade Facial Roller for Slimming & Firming | (After using this for a little while I added a star) Read to the end. This product basically fits the price tag. I have recently tried another facial roller from Amazon. Let me start with the benefits of a facial roller. It gets the blood circulating which is supposed to help plump the skin and diminish the look of wrinkles, while trying to keep new ones at bay. Supposed to help smooth out the skin, and help massage some products into your skin.<br />With that said this roller versus any other roller will have these same benefits over time. The real "jade" ones were said to have magical effects for centuries in Asia and used on the skin so that's where that comes in.<br />I personally use ...

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
You can pay a pretty penny for a skin care product that has a percentage of squalane in it, but this is 100% squalane.<br />I really like that this is plant based, as opposed to being derived from sharks, after all the result is the same.<br />A few drops and parched skin is instantly soft with just a touch of glow. Or you can mix it with any other skincare product or even a foundation, in order to make it more hydrating.<br />No fragrance whatsoever, so scent sensitive people will love this.<br />Another thing to appreciate is that the bottle and dropper are both glass.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />On its own or as an additive in a DIY creation, this may be clear, but it's liquid gold.
This product uses sugar cane instead of olives to create their squalane oil. Resulting in less oiliness while providing superb moisture to those with dry facial skin.<br />I’ve used a squalane “body” products (sugar instead of olive based), with great success. (I have KP and, dry skin in general- helped moisture and clear my KP).<br />Began using this product every night before bed upon arrival.<br />Pro’s<br />-clean ingredients<br />-no fragrance noted<br />-No oily residue on hair or pillow case (when using at night)<br />-Absorbs/sinks into skin within minutes and holds moisture<br />-noticeably smoother skin upon waking<br />-no irritation<br /><br />Con:<br />-Haven’t noticed a reduction in wrinkles (but, to be fair- not been using this long enough to give a final verdict).<br /><br />Verdict:<br />The moisturizing properties alone ...
This Beauty Stat Universal Moisture Essence is 100% Squalane from plant sugar. This is a clear, fragrance free liquid in a dropper bottle. Its non greasy, feels weightless and is non irritating to my sensitive skin. It can be applies directly to the skin, but my favorite way to use it is to add a couple drops to my face cream (and still use a serum). I’ve used it with Beauty Stat Moisture Boost Cream, but it also works great with other face creams. I even add it to my creams that fall just short of hydrating my skin enough and feel like the I get enough moisture once this squalane is added.<br /><br />I love the results of this squalane Essence as I notice it gives ...

The item description is BeautyStat Cosmetics Universal Moisture Essence, 100% Pure Squalane, Face Oil, Moisturizer, 30ml, 1oz. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I really like this brand. This is another product from Beauty Stat that I'm impressed with. I really enjoy using this oil. It's lightweight, not greasy, and doesn't leave my skin shiny. It absorbs so nicely. My skin is left feeling very soft and firm. I love the ingredients. It's definently been a great addition to my skin regimen. I recommend trying it.

Output: I use a makeup wipe and then a makeup wipe.

Avajar Perfect V Lifting Premium Eye Mask 5 Sets(10 Pairs) - Under Eye Collagen Patch | Hydrogel Anti Aging Mask for Puffy Eyes & Bags, Dark Circles and Wrinkles | Elasticity Improvement Pad | I love these easy eye treatments and have used several varients. This is a little dryer than some of the others used and definitely pulls a little more. The results are OK but I think it loses a lot from not having the extra moisture left to dab in when you remove them. Personally I prefer them with a more gel type feel.
Magnetic eyelashes with eyeliner，Beevila False Eyelashes Upgraded 5D Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit, fake eyelashes 5 Pairs with Tweezers, Easy to Wear,No glue! | These are great! I am a big fan of the liquid liner over the pens. Super easy to use and you can have professional looking lashes in 2 easy steps. This set has a nice variety of lash styles from every day to super dramatic which is nice. They say reusable - I don't reuse mine because my eyes are super sensitive so can't comment on that part but I have seen that lots of people do reuse them so it is probably personal preference but I couldn't say how many uses you might get out of each pair.
AIKIMUSE 10 Piece Nude Matte Pigmented Lipstick Set,Gifts for Women,Velvet Lip Kit Gift Set With Moisturizer Smooth,Waterproof Long Lasting Beauty Cosmetics Makeup Liquid Lipstick Set,8.8 oz | The color on these are strong, but they feel a little waxy for my preference. That being said they do stain quite well and there was a variety of red shades which means there would be something for most skin types. Just not one I can see me using on a regular basis.
MILANO COLLECTION TopGrip: No-Slip Comfort Band for Securely Wearing Lace Front Wigs, Wig Grips, Wig Caps & Glueless Wig Bands, Size Small, Beige | I wear a lot of wigs - and am always looking for anything that can make them easier to wear. This product definitely worked, was easy to use, but I am not sure that it is worth the price. I have other items that have worked as well that weren't as expensive. If this was a little cheaper though it would be fabulous for cosplayers that use a lot of different wigs / toppers.
Scrunchie Holder Stands with 8 Pack Large Size Scrunchies - Acrylic Hair Ties Organizer for Teenage Girls and VSCO Girls Gift Stuff | I LOVE Scrunchies - I am so excited that they are making a comeback and this is such a fun way to store them. I mean yes it is a little annoying if the one you want happens to be at the bottom - but not really a big deal. I think it's great that this comes with 8 scrunchies already - that in itself pretty much pays for it - but you can add lots more! If you are a scrunchie person then this is for you. I have mine on my dressing table and I love it!
Deppex Dry Eye Relief, Eye Mask for Dry Eyes, Moxibustion Eye Pad Deep Conserve The Eye to Alleviate Myopia, Visual Fatigue, Soreness, Swelling - 14 Pairs… (Eye Relief) | In England when I was younger, if your eyes were tired or puffy my mum would always tell me to put used tea bags on them. This is what these patches are like! 15 minutes wear and your eyes really do feel better - especially if you are suffering because of too much screen time. Don't be put off by the fact that the instructions aren't in English. Just take out a new pair, place on closed eyes for 15 minutes, and discard. You won't regret it!
MEICOLY 12 Pcs/set Matte Lipstick Set Long Lasting Waterproof Pen Lip Stain Set Halloween | This set is great for anyone possibly looking to try a slightly different look. 12 individual, full size lipsticks all in fall / Halloween type colors. For truer color, as with many lipsticks, several layers work better. The color lasts really well even through eating and drinking, but comes off easily with remover!
MOSTORY Glitter Crystal Liquid Eyeshadow Set - 4 Pack Pigmented Liquid Eye shadows Matte Shimmer Metallic Quick Dry Crease Resistant Long Lasting Flake-Proof Blendable Non-Greasy Eye Makeup (4 Pack) | I used the copper and the white/silver to create the effect in the picture. I love that the color was long lastig and definitely shimmery. It didn't flake off as some glitter based ones do. I found the best effect occurred if I let a layer dry and then added more - to build up the shine but if I didn't wait long enough between layers it did get a little clumpy. Overall a fun addition for the holiday / party season.

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Good thought mask were included ?
I could make something like this First Class travel kit by myself, but I see this more for gifting, putting in care packages or leaving out for guests. For those purposes, it’s decent enough for the price. I don’t like the scan square on the outside of the package though. That should have been on the instruction card.
Not sure how they make a "safety kit" without a mask, but since (i) people have their own mask preferences and they aren't usually found in a kit like this and (ii) they don't say it has a mask, I can't ding them for that.<br /><br />What's here is a good assortment of stuff you usually get if flying business or first class, save the socks.<br /><br />You get a pillowcase, good quality eye mask, good earplugs, wet wipes and tissues all in a re-usable bag that complies with TSA guidelines. The bag itself has a nice working zipper with a larger than normal tab on it.<br /><br />It would make a nice gift for someone going on their first flight who might not know the "need" ...
All the essentials necessary for traveling in comfort in a nice bag that can be used as your bag at TSA check
This is a nice kit that contains several good-to-have items for a plane flight sitting in close quarters. Included are decent antibacterial wipes, very soft tissues, and ear plugs. Also included are an eye mask, pillowcase, and a resealable quart bag that is more durable than a zip lock bag. This is a quite useful kit to pack with you for a plane trip.
Had everything needed for a trip.
Received quickly and exactly what i needed. Would order again.

Target: I am not a big traveler but this definitely has the essentials all ready to go in an FDA-approved clear bag. The items are decent quality but probably the most useful things are the bag it all comes in, and a little card that tells you all the things that you should be wiping down, a couple of which I hadn't thought of. I also hadn't thought of taking my own pillowcase before but having seen that it makes total sense. Yes, you could probably get all the things in it a little cheaper, but for convenience, this is a win. (I am also noting it as a possible stocking stuffer present for those people that are difficult to buy for and this would be an alternative to those who chocolate of bath products won't work for).

QIC 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara, Fiber Mascara, Waterproof Mascara, Natural Thick Thickening and Lengthening Mascara Lasting All Day | This reminds me so much of the first 3D mascara from Younique. This will do the same. Put on one coat of the top part and then a coat of the bottom part of the mascara. You can build up the lashes to the point that they look like fake lashes.
2 in 1 Hair Straightener and Curler Travel Curling Flat Iron Wand Crimper, Dual Voltage 110V-240V Ceramic Tourmaline 1 1/4 inch Portable | Right now, I am loving this combo straightener and curling tool. It heats up to 430 degrees, but it is in Celsius, so look at the conversion for your hair. It heats up very fast. I straightened a piece of hair and then curled it. It did a good job. I am tempted to do my entire head. What I really like is the extra long grip that keeps you from burning your fingers
STYLEAGAL False Eyelashes - 4 Pairs Multipack Natural 3D False Eyelashes Natural Thick Hand-Made Faux Mink Eyelashes Extension(G106) | These eyelashes are reusable. They are very long and give you a thick and long eyelash look. The lashes are made to last up to 25 times. I am going to be using them on ball jointed resin dolls that need new lashes. If they are too long, you can also trim them for the length of lashes or for the eyelid size.
BeautyBio GloPRO Attachment Heads | The needles in the eye microtip are not very long and they are very thin, so it is a breeze to go over your eye area and eyebrow area without pain and with ease. I want all of the needling attachment heads. These are the best I have used to date.
[FORENCOS] Eyebrow Tattoo Precision Pen- Microblading Eyebrow Pencil with a Micro-Fork Tip Applicator Creates Natural Looking Brows,Waterproof Ink Brow Gel Tint, All Day Proof (03 Ash Brown) | I was able to get my eyebrows filled in and looking great in just seconds. One eyebrow had a little oops but I used a paper towel and my nail to smooth out the area and it looks great. I could use a lighter shade but this looks fine.
10 Pcs Brown and 10 Pcs Black Wig Grip Headband for women | If you use this properly, you should get very good results. It comes with a net that you can put on your head first and then add the grip scarf. It is adjustable and it is also washable.
YoungSee 20inch Remy Human Hair Tape Extensions Balayage #Dark Brown Fading to Dark Ash Blonde with Golden Blonde Ombre Tape in Hair Extensions Real Human Hair 20pcs/50g | This is not the best quality of hair, so it makes it perfect for trying out on your head at home. I had my daughter help me put these in. We both watched videos and are still discussing the pros and cons. Now, I am not sure how you are supposed to brush near your scalp with these in, so I will need to watch a video for that too. If I decide not to use them on my head, then I will use them to make a wig for my bjd collectibles. If I do use them on my hair, after the tape has had its full life then I will find something to do with these. They are going to be used, one way or ...
BRING GREEN Fresh Bowl Pack 8g /0.28 oz. each 8 Types - Wash off, Scrub, Peel Off, Moisturizing Sleeping Capsule Mask/Reducing Pores, Sebum Control, Calming, Nourishing, Natural Ingredients Mask | Because there are ten items and 2 you leave on overnight, you need instructions on what to do with each one. What I did, was make a screen print of the instructions so I will know how to use each. When these came in, it was like trying to hold an open bag of potatoes. The packaging was not good and I had these pods falling all over the place. What is in each pod? Got me. Makes my face feel good though. The only ingredients on the selling page is honey, yogurt and sugar. I know there has to be different ingredients for each pod, so that is definitely not right for the ingredients,

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
I love the combination of this shampoo and conditioner. Both smell like sweet coconut.<br />The shampoo has a thick and luxurious lather and definitely feels like it adds volume to my hair.<br />The conditioner is thick, but light, a bit like a body butter. It softens my hair and leaves it extremely soft and silky.<br />The only reason I can't give these products five stars is because I think they're a bit overpriced. Yes, they create great results, but so do a lot of comparable brands that are less than half the price.
Have been using for 3years. Hair FHAs more body and looks fuller. Having trouble with them sending conditioners rather than shampoo as ordered. Costly to return so I now have 4 conditioners and one dwindling shampoo. May have to switch brand. The product does what it claims. Taya is the only product I use at this time, but if they keep sending conditioners, I will stop ordering from them
This comes as a set and no matter what I do, the shampoo bottle will not open. This absolutely infuriates me. I was able to open the conditioner. I removed plastic seal on the top of both bottles and turned as specified on the bottle. I spent 10 minutes trying to open the shampoo. Unless I take a hammer and chisel to it or an exacto knife, I can't use the shampoo.<br /><br />The conditioner is nice and has a subtle fresh aroma but without the pair, this is zero stars to me when I cannot get to the product.
This shampoo and conditioner combo made my hair very soft. It also smells very good, which is something I'm picky about. I also like the unique twist bottles.<br /><br />As far as breakage, there hasn't been any change from my usual shampoo and conditioner. I am still shedding quite a bit.
This shampoo and conditioner leaves hair feeling clean, soft, and manageable after the first use. It smells nice, too, which is also a plus!<br />My hair is not that of a teen or even young adult anymore so it's been through a lot. When looking for shampoo and conditioning products I tend to look closer at those that claim to make hair stronger, reduce breakage, and things with words like "restore" and "fortify". These hit the mark so I decided to give them a shot.<br />I've been using them about three weeks and I think that they are definitely doing my hair some good. It looks healthy and feels very soft. The conditioner does a good job with tangles and knots. I do sometimes still use a ...
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this duo!! It makes my thin finge long hair feel so luxurious and full. It takes care of tangles too. I just wish the bigger bottle duo was still available. I love this!! I never want to do without it!!!
My hair are really long, thin, bleached blonde and tangles easily. This shampoo and conditioner set is fantastic. My hair feels much more silky and manageable. I can brush it through after washing much easier.<br />I really like the pleasant scent of these products.<br /> The top of the bottle is a twist to squeeze just the right amount of product.<br />It is not cheap but for sure worth it.
While replacement of the first defective bottle was immediate, nobody checked to see if the second one had the same problem....THE SHAMPOO BOTTLE WILL NOT OPEN. I would have to take a tool to break in to the shampoo!! Please establish some quality control!!! Wont be buying again

Target: I have that thin strands of hair that can be enhanced with this product. My hair tends to get limp looking. In fact, most of the time it is in a hair clip or a scrunchy. This helps make my hair stronger, have more volume and styling is much nicer looking.

ELEVEN EVER Electric Nail Drill, Professional Portable Nail File Drill Grinder Manicure Pedicure Tools for Polishing, Sanding, Removing Gel and Acrylic Nails (silver) … (silver) (ND-02black) | This electric drill comes with about 11 different drill bits and sanding pieces for the grinders. This also comes with a brush to remove the powder you get from the drill. You also get spreaders for your hands. It also has dust covers for the drill and an emery board. This is strong enough to also use on your pets to grind down their nails.
Women Facial Razor for Hair Removal - Dermaplaning Tool Peach Fuzz Trimmer Womens Fine Hair Remover Eyebrow Razors and Dermaplane Face Shavers Women's Exfoliating for Sensitive Skin Essential Travel | I don't know if these will get much use. I don't know how to use them properly for my eyebrows and will have to do some u tubing to find out. There are not any instructions included. I do know I will not use them on any area other than my eyebrows. Some women will probably use them on their upper lip and chin area but not me. I have always felt like if you shave some areas, more hair grows back in. This may be a myth. But my daughter shaved her belly and her arms and she has hair growth that is darker than what she had previously. She did this for a few years and has since stopped, but the hairs on her torso ...
PARWIN Infrared Flat Iron 1 1/4 Inch Digital Hair Straightener Iron with Ceramic Tourmaline Plate Temperature Control Hair Iron Christmas Gift Black | I am very careful with heat that I apply to my hair and I don't use it often, just to keep the hair free from split ends. This worked much better than I anticipated. The infrared didn't seem to hurt my hair and it doesn't have a bunch of frizzees from where it will fall off if the heat is too high. I have had beauticians use to much heat and have that happen. I am pleased with this iron.
Retinol Face Moisturizer Cream Natural Facial moisturizing Cream 1.76 OZ with Ortho-Hydroxybenzoic Acid,VE for Hydrating,Repairing | This facial moisturizer is great. when you use hyaluronic acid products, you should follow with a good moisturizer. This fits the bill. Now, I have a complete set of this line that I am very pleased with. They also make a body moisturizer that is great on your heels.
Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | This gel nail set comes with 6 different colors that they have themed as "Love Spectrum". The colors are quite nice. You will need to get a UV LED Lamp. You will also need to get the Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish Soak Off UV LED Gel Base Coat and No Wipe Top Coat Gel Polish Set. All of these items can be purchased on Amazon. They recommend that you put on layers and each layer should be thin. Follow all instructions and you will have beautiful shiny nails.
Professional Grade Retinol Anti-Aging Skin Moisturizing Cream - For Age Spots - By Swiss Botany | Swiss Botany makes wonderful products and I have never been disappointed. The serum soaks in and your skin gets smooth. Anything that works on almost 60 year old skin is fantastic in my book
Spring Twist hair 3PCS Crochet Braids Hair Synthetic Hair 8 Inch Jumbo Twist Braiding Hair Extensions Natural Black | I am using these braids to make doll wigs for collectible fashion dolls. These will work out great to give an updated look to some of my girls.
BeautyBio GloPRO Attachment Heads | The needles in the eye microtip are not very long and they are very thin, so it is a breeze to go over your eye area and eyebrow area without pain and with ease. I want all of the needling attachment heads. These are the best I have used to date.

What a great set! Very good quality, not at all flimsy. Love the colors and it's easy to separate items to carry because these are color coded .. you could go with matching these bottles with what's the closest color to the product you're going to carry. The tops are secure. Squeezable and easy to get the right amount without any leakage. The little jars are wonderful too. Best of all these are all TSA approved sizes and capacity. There are enough to make two sets of all of my products and take one set in my check in luggage and carry the other set in a handbag. Much better quality than drugstore brands. These are sturdier. And great value for money.

The item description is Cosmetic Travel Containers, Leakproof Silicone Travel Bottles Set, TSA Approved Travel Size Cosmetic Toiletries Containers Accessories Set for Shampoo Conditioner Facial Cleanser Cream. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: When you go on a 7 day cruise, you generally pack up your beauty creams and lotions and your hair care items, like shampoo, conditioner, hot iron protector, etc. That is if you drive. All of these items take up a lot of space and they way down your luggage. These just came in and I am going to take these instead. The bottles have big holes for pouring in your liquids and the small containers can easily hold enough facial creams to last a week. The bottles have a flip top to get the liquid out. The others are screw on lids that you can unscrew to get to the creams.

Output: Very good quality, not at all flimsy. Love the colors and it's easy to separate items.

Aloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz) | As an Aloe Vera product, this gel is OK. Its moisturizing capabilities are below average and its soothing abilities on tender skin are average.<br /><br />The gel leans thin-ish for a "thick" gel. The smell is light and inoffensive. The seller says this can be used as a base to make homemade hand sanitizer and the thickness is about on par with typical hand sanitizers on the market.
DERMALOGY by NEOGENLAB Real Charcoal Pad, 60 Count | These charcoal pads are intended to be used after you wash your face. They are suppose to draw out impurities (charcoal side) and soothe the skin for a "healthier" look.<br /><br />The pads are premoistened and have plenty of moisture. It is easy to discern the charcoal side. After about 3 weeks of use every 3rd day, I cannot see the difference in my skin. I'm not a heavy make-up wearer, so this may be a factor in trying to see noticeable differences when using/not using the Neogen charcoal pad.
Mountain Falls Regular Dip-It Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails, with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 9 Fluid Ounce | This dip in nail polish is essentially a container size sponge soaked in nail polish remover. The sponge acts as the abrasive to assist the nail polish remover liquid complete the removal job. It works pretty well on fingers - you have th kind of twist your fingers around/about. Can't see using this for toes at all.<br /><br />3-1/2 stars because limited use. Still need to use cotton ball and remove on toes.
Yes To Face Wipes for Women and Men, Sensitive Facial Cleansing Wipes for use as a Make Up Remover, Cleaning, Soothing, Cucumbers Aloe Vera (Pack of 2) | These Yes wipes feel equivalent to others on the market & they remove makeup about as well as other makeup removal wipes.<br /><br />I am not a heavy makeup user - very light foundation, powder, a little blush & a little eye shadow. The wipes do not completely remove makeup/residue, so if I use the wipes exclusively, I will get clogged pores within a couple of weeks. This result is the same using other manufacturer's wipes. Consequently, while super convenient especially while traveling, if I travel with make-up wipes, I also travel with blemish cream.
Precision Clean Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush | My family has used Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes for years. We end up replacing them after about 3 years or so, but, at a price under $20 each, it still is cheaper than a Sonicare. The replacement head brushes are about the same price as the more expenseive rechargeables, and we purchase them at Sam's and on line. And, in the end, the results are what matter. No one in our family has had a cavity in over 7 years. Some of that has to be the results of a good toothbrushing (especially with my children).

This set works great. It makes it super easy to keep your beard neatly trimmed. It also works super well for cutting hair. You can even use it to cut designs into hair. It's really super useful. It's feels high quality and like it will last through a whole lot of uses.
After the last trimmer I bought on line several months ago, I was skeptical but went for it anyway. The last one I got took 2 months to come in, the *metal teeth were broken and it didn’t work except for making a very loud noise. This one came in and I was very happy that I took the leap! It is well-made and I like that the parts not only fit tightly, but also come apart easily, even for cleaning the main metal comb.<br /><br />I like that it has a digital reading that tells you how long you have for use, although it doesn’t quite hit the full mark on time, so be aware of that. I haven’t had any issues with any of the ...
I bought this item as a gift for my husband. He tried it out this morning and was extremely impressed! It gave a nice smooth, clean shave. He really like the nose/ear trimmer attachment too! It was very easy and quick to charge too.
Clippers work great. My husband was able to trim his hair and beard with ease. Battery lasted decently & I love that it comes with a wide range of accessories.
Like how easy it is to change the heads, height adjustment is great, shave looks good.
Great trimmer for the price. The fact that you can interchange parts to the use that you need is great. I would use this more as a trimmer than as a shaver. As you can see in the pictures. The shaver trims but doesn’t give a clean shave. Again this is listed as a trimmer. And it does trim very nice. The fact that you can change the number of the trim by turning the knob is very convenient. Overall great trimmer for the price. Does not bring a charger. The cable must be plugged in to any usb charger.
Works good a little hard to change heads
I definitely looked forward to receiving this in the mail because it offered a lot of things normal hair trimmers don’t offer. There’s a lot of attachments, and some attachments work better than others, but overall I’m glad I bought it. It doesn’t look very solid, so I don’t know how long it will work, but maybe it will be just fine

The item description is Hair Clipper Beard Trimmer Kit for Men,Cordless Hair Trimmer Mustache Trimmer Body Groomer Trimmer for Nose Ear Facial Hair with LED Display USB Rechargeable 5 In 1. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: Review from my bearded spouse:<br /><br />Things I like about this trimmer:<br />1. The dial adjustment works very well for the gate.<br />2. The trimmer is very quiet (especially compared to my old one).<br />3. The nose/ear trimmer works better than any I have ever used before.<br />4. I generally use a razor for shaving but the two micro screen shaving heads work well for a quick clean up (beware of an occasional pulled whisker).<br />5. For my beard and mustache, the large trimmer used with the gate does a fantastic job.<br />6. Doesn't come with an adapter to plug the USB charging cord into the wall.<br /><br />Verdict: great for beard, mustache and ear/nose hair removal, but I wouln't want to use it as an everyday shaver

Output: Great product. Great price. Great quality. Great product.
