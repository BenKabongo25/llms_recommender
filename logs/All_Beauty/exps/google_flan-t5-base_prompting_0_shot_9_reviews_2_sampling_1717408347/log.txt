AMAJULIE Non Slip Flexible Silicon Wigs Fix Strong Hold Comfort Silicone Lace Wig Grip Transparent Headband Hair Band Adjustable for Lace Wigs (Light Brown) | This is a great option for full or frontal lace wigs. I like that it's not too thick, and even though it's a bit tight, it's not uncomfortable. | 5.0
20 PCS Zoostliss Nail Polish Remover Clips | I recently started doing dip nails and they're definitely more work to remove than normal polish. But I like these clips to ensure that the acetone is really working into the polish and isn't sliding. | 5.0
NATWAG Reusable Update Makeup Remover Cloths for Sensitive Skin - Microfiber Face Cloth Makeup Remover | Washable Round Makeup Remover Pads | Natural Facial Towels (2 Pads,2 Cloth) (Purple) | I LOVE makeup removing cloths. I don't use them solo — only with a makeup remover or micellar water. But these things are great because they're gentle on your skin and are far more economical and environmentally friendly than using disposable wipes. | 5.0
6 Pack Soft Headband BEoffer Coral Fleece Women Makeup Spa Head Bands Turban Fashion Bow Bowknot Hairlace Headwear Wash Face Hair Holder Elastic Top Knot Bandage Girl Baby Hair Accessories 6 Colors | I like these because they keep my baby hairs back when I'm giving myself a home facial. And I love that there are multiples so I'm never without a hairband even when one or more are in the laundry. | 5.0
short bob human hair wigs lace front human hair wigs straight bob wigs natural color | I'm always nervous about ordering human hair wigs through Amazon because you never know what you're going to get but this one was nice. I've been thinking about cutting my actual hair into an angled bob but wanted to test run the length first. So I got this wig and I love how it looks. I also love that I was able to lightly bleach highlights into the wig and the hair took it easily. So the quality on this wig is great. | 5.0
JPNK 10PCS Makeup tool set, Blender Sponges& Air cushion puff&Sponge Holder for Blending Liquid, Cream or Flawless Powder Cosmetics | These are great sponges. Sometimes when you buy knockoff versions of a Beauty Blender, they can be hard or don't work like you would expect. But these sponges are soft and work great wet or dry. | 5.0
Gifts for Dad from Daughter Son, Unique Fathers Day Christmas Birthday Gift Ideas for Men Father Him, Cool Gadgets Stocking Stuffers for Men, 16 in 1 Stainless Steel Manicure Set (Zang Cyan) | My husband is ALWAYS trying to "borrow" pieces from my manicure kit. In particular, he always tries to take my cuticle nippers and nail clippers — and then doesn't put them back. So, then when I need them, I can't find them...not cool. So I'm giving him this as one of his many Christmas gifts because I'm tired of chasing him for my stuff. He'll say he doesn't need it...but he does! | 5.0

12ML Refillable Perfume Atomizer Bottle for Travel Spray Scent Pump Case Pack of 5 | These are a hit and miss. Some work, some don't. I got these for my husband because he has an extensive cologne collection and he likes to buy and sell. Some of them leaked and didn't fill well. 2 were useable. | 3.0
Purifying Face Oil for Natural Skin Radiance - Vegan, Anti Aging Face Oil for Women & Men - Ultra Hydrating and Nourishing Face Oil for Dry Skin Sensitive - Ayurveda Oil for Face by Iryasa - 1 fl.oz | While this does absorb into your skin, I don't like the feel of it, it also made my skin breakout. I'm surprised that I'm the only one to say this. While it seems to have good ingredients, it's not for me | 2.0
Beurer Luxury Pedicure Foot Spa | Foot Bath Spa with Heat and Massage | Variable Water Temperature | Portable Foot Soaking Tub for Relaxing Foot Reflex Zone Massage, FB13, White | I'm a fan of pedicures. I get one every other week, sometimes my daughter goes as well. I used this on myself and my 5 yr old. This isn't any better than the Conair we own. It doesn't do anything special to warrant such a high price of 68.47. We both liked it as a fun little thing to do at home but we won't be skipping the salon. | 3.0
Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/towel (3) Blue Yellow and Pink | I don't know how I never heard of this before. I love this, it feels a little rough but my skin has gotten used to it and I love how my skin feels. I had some acne problems on my back during the summer and within a couple weeks, all gone no problems what so ever. I tried to use it on my daughter but she says it hurts, so it's back to wash cloths as after reading an article on loofahs, those will never be in my house every again. This dries well and it's perfect for your back without having to buy a different bath item. | 5.0
Magnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Kit, Magnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, 5 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelashes with Tweezer, False Lashes | These don't work if you are korean and don't have eyelids. My eyelashes are straight and when you put these on, you can see my straight lashes. Also some of them are over the top and not right for me. I liked 2 pairs but it was so hard to put on and it looked good except my straight lashes that show. | 3.0
The Henna Guys Hair Finishing Stick, Frizz Control Hair products, Broken Baby Hair Gel - Hair Wax Stick for Flyaway Hair - Faster & Quickest Solution for Neat Hair Styles (1 Pack) | I put this in my girls hair because they have all these baby hairs. At first I was like WOW! and then a few min later of normal activities, I see that their baby hairs all over the place. UGH | 2.0
Butecare Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum for Long - Amazon Vine | This made my eyes water like crazy, it was so awful I had to just wash my face and it still watered after. I threw it in the garbage. | 1.0
PARWIN Infrared Flat Iron 1 1/4 Inch Digital Hair Straightener Iron with Ceramic Tourmaline Plate Temperature Control Hair Iron Christmas Gift Black | I love this flat iron. It's easy to use, doesn't get hot and does a great job of straightening and curling. It is easy and simple to use as well as the heat functions. I use this and my flat iron that is like 8 years old. I use this on both my 3 yr old, my 7 yr old and myself. | 5.0
AuroTrends Makeup Remover Towel,2 Pack Reusable Chemical-free Microfiber Makeup Remover Cloths,Magically and Gently Wipe Away Cosmetics,Sunscreen,Oil and Dirt,Set of 2 (Pink+Black) | It's super plush but it's so small, it makes for a good bath cloth. My girls love how soft it is and they use it in the tub. The hooks are nice to hang up to dry. It's well made and thick, it's not thin at all. | 4.0

Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | Well, I do have a setting light. These polishes work fine. I think some of the premium ones, like OPI, work better, and are easier to see what colors are in the bottle. But, for the price they are OK. Gel polish is a pain to use. | 4.0
Wahl Smart Shave Rechargeable lithium ion wet / dry water proof foil shaver for men. Smartshave technology for shaving, trimming, and wet or dry shave with precision ground trimmer blade #7061-900 | My husband is very happy with this razor. I think of Wahl as a hair clipper and probably wouldn't have thought of them when replacing his razor, but I am glad to have learned that they make just as good of a quality razor. He uses a regular razor in the shower, then runs an electric around to catch any missed spots. Because of this the battery doesn't need to be charged very often. The battery life indicator is very helpful as is the razor's ability to charge very quickly. He likes it. He is not raving about it being the best razor ever, but we are both happy with this unit. | 4.0
Neutrogena Fragrance-Free Lightweight Body Oil for Dry Skin, Sheer Moisturizer in Light Sesame Formula, 8.5 fl. oz | The oil itself is great, but to me it smells like suntan oil. I use coconut oil, also scented but very lightly and it dissipates quickly, after a shower. Although I love Neutrogena stuff and use many of their products, I will stick to [[ASIN:B00P8CQK90 Fractionated Coconut Oil - 100% Pure Premium Grade - PUMP + SQUEEZE CAP + FREE Recipe eBook! - BIG 16Oz - Best Carrier Oil & Base For Essential Oils, Aromatherapy & Massage - Great for Roll-On Bottles - Soothing for Skin & Hair!]] | 3.0

Bride and Bride Tribe bachelorette hair ties, Set of 7 Bachelorette Party Hair Ties, To have and to hold your hair back hair ties, Bachelorette goodie bags, (Black Bride Tribe) | These are very well made hair ties, Colors are nice looking, no smudged / odd designed meaning ...the patterns look like the actual photos. These can be washed and dried and do NOT fall apart. I have thick curly hair and these do NOT get tangled in my hair at all. Will buy more of this style for workouts. Overall pretty inexpensive and a fun gift. | 5.0
Eternal Matte Lovers Collection – 3 Long Lasting, Fast Dry Colors and 1 Nail Treatment, Matte Top Coat – 13.5 Fluid Ounces Each | These are cute. Thick polishes, depending on how you paint your nails (thick / thin coat) you may only need 1 layer of this polish. For me, I like to do a single thick coat if possible. This polish allows that with no major issues. I did dry / set using a lamp and found that with base coat and 1 coat of this 120 sec was perfect drying time. (that of course may vary for each person). I do like the matte look this one isn't so flat that it looks like chalk. Overall, nice colors, price point is reasonable for what you get. Polish has lasted over a week with no major chips or peeling. | 4.0
Beast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast | There is a mild menthol scent to this body wash. What is nice about it, is that it doesn't smell medicated just refreshing. Your body does get a cooling sensation which is perfect to use as an after workout cleansing soap. The scent doesn't linger and this foams nicely when using. Small amount goes a long way. No skin irritations/breakouts when using. | 5.0
CLAIR BEAUTY Rose Anti Aging Day Cream & Sleep Mask Collection Gift Set - Moisturizing, Firming, Lifting & Rejuvenating | Reduces Wrinkles & Fine Lines | Tones & Smooths Skin | Made in Korea | This is a pretty nice gift set. The scent is mild and doesn't linger all night long. I have had no rashes or breakouts while using and my skin feels very moisturized. The day cream doesn't take long to absorb into the skin and make-up is applied over it without any issues. The sleep mask doesn't leave a tacky / sticky residue either. Overall, this is a nice product. | 4.0
Sdara Aloe Vera Gel For Face and Body - Organic & Natural, Soothing & Cooling For Sunburn Relief, Restorative For Dry Skin - Made In USA | I don't like that this is advertised as being 100% aloe when it has additives to it like Phenoxyethanol & Xantham Gum just to list a few. I get sometimes having to add preservatives but one of these is listed as a seriously harmful skin care product.<br /><br />Now, if you aren't worried about it. Then Yes, this is a thicker gel like cream. The scent is actually very nice and it goes on smoothly to your skin. The absorption is rather quick and doesn't leave a sticky / tacky coating on your skin. Did not stain clothing and when it did get onto clothing washed out completely.<br /><br />Overall, comes down to what you are comfortable using for YOU which is why I gave it three ... | 3.0
Magnesium Serum For Kids - All Natural Rub for Kids and Babies, Toxic Free + Free Magnesium Chart PDF | I think it smells nice and it a great idea to calm kids. At first, I this was working great because our little ones were not waking up in the middle of the night. But after about a week, that seemed to stopped.<br /><br /> I have found that using this a couple of times a week is giving us some better results.. Overall, any help is great help., | 4.0
TELETIES - Tie Dye Collection - Spiral Hair Coils - Ponytail Holder Hair Ties for Women - Phone Cord Hair Ties - Strong Grip, No Rip, Water Resistant, No Crease Hair Tie Coils - 3 pack (Large, Trippy Hippie) | These are better then average coil hair ties. The plastic coating is smooth throughout the coils and didn't get caught or pull my hair. They are rather large and have a decent amount of stretch to them, you can twist them 2 or 3 times to get a tight hold. Also, again, when removing since the edges are all smooth they didn't get tangled or caught in my hair. While I haven't seen this issue it may come up over time since they are plastic they might loose some of there elasticity over time . | 5.0
Sunsonic Electric Razor, Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Pop Up Beard Trimmer, Type-C USB Mens Electric Razor. | This is a light weight and pretty great starter shaver for someone. I do like that is arrives with a charge so you can use it right out of the box. You get a charging cable but is is rather short and you do NOT get a wall plug so you will need your own connector.<br /><br />The side open trimmer is easy to open and use as well.<br /><br />My largest issue is the noise level of this shaver. It's about double the volume of other brands I have used. Additionally, I don't know if this would hold up if dropped in water or on the floor. Just a FYI the plastic housing unit feel very thin.<br /><br />Overall, for the price point is a pretty ... | 4.0
Magic Wand Makeup Brushes Set - 5pcs Wizard Wand Makeup Brushes Foundation Blending Blush Eyeshadow Face Lip Powder Brush Beauty Tools (New-Bronze) | Honestly I was expecting comical plastic brushes. I received die cast heavy well made brushes! The little bag for storage isn't the best quality but the brushes more then make up for the bags issues. Each little wand has some noticeable weight to them. The detailing is impressive and wraps around the entire brush handle. The brushes themselves are somewhat small but that is useful when doing fine details. More then likely these will just be on display more then used. For the price point super amazing gift for any fan of fantasy. | 5.0

JIADEL Gel Nail Polish Colors Set,Confetti Glitter Gel Nail Polish With No Wipe Base and Top Coat,Soak Off UV LED Nail Art Salon Starter Manicure Kit | This has such nice colors and glitters! There are only about 2-3 regular colors. The rest are glitters and I did notice there were a few that looked like duplicates but will have to see how they apply once in the nail. I love the variety of the set and you don’t need to do multiple coats. I also like that the bottles have a little clear circle to preview the color! | 5.0
Soo'AE Sweet Pink Bubble Mask, Clarifying & Softening, 1 Count | Gave this to my daughter. She loved to watch it foam up and get puffy. Can’t tell if it made a difference in her skin, just wanted something fun for her to do! | 5.0
CIMIY Gel Nail Polish Set 8 bottles - Manicure Colors Infinity with Top Base Coat for Forest Nail Art Natural Daily All Seasons for Nail Profession Salon and Starter at Home Soak Off UV LED 0.32oz | It’s a nice set of colors but it’s so thick to apply that kind of made the application hard but also a pro because you don’t need multiple coats. Colors were earth toned and very nice. | 4.0

Biutee Nail Stamping Plates 5pcs Templates With Stamper Scraper Set Nail Art Plates set animal flower Christmas halloween design | This didn’t work as well as I would have hoped maybe have to practice a few times.

My thumb is a size 0 and it’s so hard to get nails that actually fit which is why I ended up doing my own nails in the first place<br /><br />I’m so glad they included the same design but in different shapes because I would’ve thrown a fit otherwise when I saw those short ballerina nails.<br /><br />Around the edges of the nails you can see the color fading out where it was printed but that doesn’t bother me too much | 5.0

Women Facial Razor for Hair Removal - Dermaplaning Tool Peach Fuzz Trimmer Womens Fine Hair Remover Eyebrow Razors and Dermaplane Face Shavers Women's Exfoliating for Sensitive Skin Essential Travel | These are some pretty fantastic razors. They are straight edged, but the provided safety edging prevents me from nicking myself while keeping the blade close to my skin.<br />It removes peach fuzz quickly, efficiently. My skin is super smooth for about a week after use. My makeup goes on like butter, and I am convinced my moisturizers and serums also work better on my dermaplaned skin.<br />They are small and precision enough that I can use them around my eyebrows, though I go slow and don't usually use them for that.<br />But for my upper lip, chin, cheeks and forehead I don't know how I got by before these. While my easy to use electric is nice, these are so much closer. Will be a faithful weekly user! | 5.0
100 pcs Compressed Facial Mask Women DIY Beauty Facial Cotton Paper Compress Masque Disposable Dry Sheet Mask for Skin Face Care | I wasn't sure what to expect from these compressed facial masks in terms of quality, as reviews were across the board. But, they far exceeded my needs and expectations!<br />They are about the size of three dimes stacked, and are embossed with little flowers on top, which is really just a pretty presentation.<br />They expand easily with moisture, I mixed up my own serum solution with essential oil, and it was easy to soak and unfold. I worried I would have to be super delicate so as not to tear the paper, but these are more of a fabric than tissue.<br />In fact, I opened one up to test it's durability. I used some warm water, added some dish soap and went to town scrubbing my basin. ... | 5.0
TOUCH IN SOL Flawless Skin Top Coat 1.18 fl.oz. (35ml) - One Step Makeup (Nourishing Ampoule + High Adhesive Makeup Base + Fresh Silky Powder), Moisturizing High Coverage Foundation (#1 Light) | My friend recommended this Touch in Sol Flawless skin top coat, and I am so glad she did.<br />It is really more of a foundation, it has perfect medium coverage. It feels amazing on my skin, light and silky smooth. It leaves me looking matte, but not dry. It's surprisingly radiant.<br />I use it over the Touch in Sol primer, without setting powder, and it easily lasts the whole day.<br />So, here I am recommending it to you! Try it! It's amazing! | 5.0
The Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine | This is actually a decent palette of eyeshadows. They are not super pigmented, but very easy to work with. This is a very nice beginner palette, especially for the under 10 price.<br />That said, these need a primer. They last an okay amount of time, but will fade quickly if you don’t use a primer.<br />Simple cardboard container, very similar to colourpop and bh, but doesn’t have a mirror. Still it’s sturdy and all the pans arrived unbroken!<br />The shades are arranged nicely, it really has a visual appeal, and makes choosing an eye look easier.<br />It’s realky not bad, and while my tastes typically run towards the more luxury and pigmented, this is a good entry for a beginner or lighter makeup user.<br />I will be ... | 3.0
AG Care Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar Leave On Mist | This leave in hair remedy from AG smells wonderful, like a sweet and spicy scent. While it applies strong, it dissipated and left behind a soft clean spicy smell.<br />It worked really well, and was best when I used it after a work out on damp hair vs dry or showered.<br />It’s a nice product in my easy care hair Arsenal, I will be picking it up again for my gym bag for sure! | 4.0
30 PCS Blue Hair Care Rollers Hair Curlers Silicone No Clip Hair Style Rollers Soft Magic DIY Curling Hairstyle Tools Hair Accessories | These are an inexpensive and fairly comfortable way to roll my hair at night. It makes getting up and being ready to go in the morning much faster, since all I have to do is unroll, give a spray and shake - and bam waves for days.<br />However, the quality is decent but not great, one of the rollers looked like it was left out side and got chewed on. But, 1 out of 30 (I counted them) is still good odds for the price.<br />They came in the matching clear blue zipper bag, and are easy to store. I'd happily purchase another set. | 4.0

After using this soap for a while the soap leaves a lemon grass smell mix with this other scent that I don’t know how to describe but I don’t really like the smell of the scent. The soap itself is great though the texture is more of a gooey slime feeling compare to other soaps that I have used | 3.0

8 Packs 26 Inch Pre-Stretched Braiding Hair Extensions 90g Easy Braid Professional Itch Free Synthetic Fiber Corchet Braids Yaki Texture Hot Water Setting Braids (#1B) | Love this pre stretched hair. It makes braiding my hair way easier. The hair is soft and I didn’t get tangling. It came with a crochet needle which was a good bonus. | 5.0
Newcally Eyelashes 25MM Long False Lashes Faux Mink Dramatic Messy Lashes 5 Pairs | I thought these lashes might be too much for me but after trying them out I fell in love. I had to cut them to fit my eyes but they still look good. | 5.0
Leuxe Facial Cleansing Brush, IPX6 Waterproof Rotating Face Brush for Deep Cleansing, 3 Modes and Smart Timer | I like the size of this brush, it makes it easier to travel with. The shape of the brush also makes it comfortable to hold as I exfoliate. The bristles are soft, I just wish it came with an extra brush head. It exfoliates my face nicely and doesn’t feel too harsh. It left my face feeling smoother and really clean. | 5.0
Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion - Superfood Infused Firming Body Lotion with Kale. 6.8 fl.oz, Anti-Aging Moisturizing Lotion For All Skin Types | It smells like perfume. I haven’t noticed a huge difference with my skin yet but I only have been using it a few days. The lotion isn’t thick but lightweight and smells so good! | 5.0
talever Brazilian Body Wave Human Hair Weave 1 Bundle, 100% Virgin Unprocessed Human Hair Weft Natural Color 100g/pc(14) | I was surprised about the quality of this hair. It very soft and silky. I was able to straighten and style this hair with no issues. It was flowy and looks very realistic when I added it to my install. Would recommend! | 5.0
JARGOD 1pcs 100% Kolinsky Sable Acrylic Nails Round Nail Art Brush (size 2) | I got this to use for my poly gel kit. I like to use this brush with the slip solution. Great for fills. I want to try the bigger size too. | 5.0
Teeth Whitening Powder Kit 2.1oz Activated Charcoal Toothpaste Powder Teeth Whitener Remove Coffee Wine Tobacco Stains Gum Health and Fresh Breath with Toothbrush & Tongue Cleaner | I did notice my teeth appeared whiter but man this charcoal is messy! When you think you’re being careful by keeping your mouth close while brushing somehow splatter gets somewhere. Then you spit it out and it messes up the skin and walls and mirror. Be prepared to clean! Love the fact that it whitens my teeth and doesn’t taste bad. | 5.0
COSYMAY 22'' Curly Wig for Women Natural Black Human Hair Wig Middle Part 13x4'' Lace Front Wig Kinky Curly Deep Wave Brazilian Virgin Remy Hair Wig 1B | The curls in this wig are looser, the wig is nice but the curls are way looser. The wig had a chemical smell too it, something like ammonia. The lace is thin and a bit too dark for my complexion but I think I can tweak it a bit. The wig is also a bit thin. | 3.0
Workman's Friend Ultimate Hand Care Bundle | My hands are dry and cracked. These products haven’t made my hands feel softer and moisturized. I was extremely pleased they have a skin cream too. I use the cream on my elbows and other dry patches of skin. I have seen some improvement on my elbows where it isn’t as rough. | 5.0

LANGE HAIR Extendé Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ | This is so far my favorite luxury detangling spray. My hair and my girls look and feels so nice after using this. I love that it combines multiple products.<br /><br />What I dislike. The price. Why is this $22??! | 4.0
Glass Nail File - JORLAI 2PC Nano Nail Shiner Nail Files Polisher Glass Nail Buffers Professional Crystal Manicure Tools Kit for Natural Nails | My sister got a glass file YEARS ago, it broke, so she gave it to me. I've had this thing for almost a decade and wanted something similar.<br /><br />While these are pretty dang close, I have just one tiny complaint. How it curves on the side, can make for tighter and more difficult side files. Like when you have a hangnail on the side of your nail. It works great on the top.<br /><br />I do love the colors, size, and the case. I keep this in my purse for nail emergencies, so it doesn't get the most usage. | 5.0
Vekola 2 Pcs Kids Neck Gaiter Face Mask | COVID Prevention<br /> These are too breathable to really protect you from COVID- if this is your concern.<br /><br />COVID Mask Requirements<br /> If you are needing something to go to the store, but don't worry about COVID- these are perfect.<br /><br />Outdoor use<br /> My kids wear these when they are out playing in the dead leaves, or when it is really dusty windy when they are riding their bikes. They love them.<br /><br />If you have longer short hair, how it holds up it does get into the hairline at the back of your neck. | 5.0
Qiray Hair Ties For Women Coil Hair Ties,Large Lace Phnom Penh,5 Colors 10 Pieces. | My girls have been trying different scrunches, and this is by far their favorite. It makes them feel pretty, but also is able to tighten enough in their hair, that it actually holds.<br /><br />I personally, would not wear them as they are not my style, but for a 10-year-old and 7-year-old, they are in love. | 5.0
NATWAG Reusable Update Makeup Remover Cloths for Sensitive Skin - Microfiber Face Cloth Makeup Remover | Washable Round Makeup Remover Pads | Natural Facial Towels (2 Pads,2 Cloth) (Purple) | They are so soft on my face and don't cause any abrasions when I use them.<br /><br />My face is sensitive and I live in the desert. It's a constant battle over trying to clean my face, but not cause extras stress with making it dry and scratch.<br /><br />I honestly just love feeling them with how soft they are. | 5.0
Mini Rubber Bands Soft Elastic Bands for Kids Hair Non-slip Rubber Hair Bands Soft Hair Elastics Ties Bands Braids Hair for Girls - STRONG - REUSEABLE (Colorful1000+Black1000) | I really like these a lot. They are easy to open and use on my girl's hair. Even on my hair. Depending on how I put it on, it is sometimes easier to just cut them out instead of reusing them, but you can reuse them. | 5.0
2020 UPGRADED Exfoliating Loofah Sponge Pads, Natural Luffa Material Loofah Pads Shower Body Scruber for Men/Women Bath Spa and Shower (3 Pack) | Are these super nice luxurious loofahs, you won't get that. But if you want something that does what it needs to do, but may not hold up for a long time. Then that is what you are going to get.<br /><br />You get what you paid for, and I have no complaints. | 5.0
Facial Cleansing Brush, Sonic Ultrasonic Vibration Facial Brush, Red-light for Deep Cleaning, Discharge Makeup, Gentle Exfoliating, Blackhead Removing, Massaging with 3 Adjustable Modes and Speeds | It is fun to use and feels nice while using it (1-month using the product). However, I haven't seen any benefits to this than the little circle ones that look like this but you use manually.<br /><br />I will continue to use it, and if anything changes, I will update my review. Maybe I just need more time to see a difference. | 3.0
2PCS Hair Clips Hairpin Headwear Styling Tools Double Layer Twist Plait Tools Hairstyle Hair Twister Clip Multi-Layer Hollow Woven Double Bangs for Knitting Hair | I can not use these on myself and I struggle using these on my girls.<br /><br />Sometimes the clips are really picky. They don't clip, or it feels like too much hair, so you lessen the hair, and then it is not enough hair to hold the clip.<br /><br />I don't know if it is me, or the device itself.<br /><br />I really love the concept, but by the time I put in, to try to get it to work, the simplicity that this product should bring is removed, and I just should have done what works first. | 3.0

Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | This is a nice set of six nail polishes, all in identical black bottles. I assume this is because the polishes are light sensitive and so the black bottles protect all of them from degrading due to harsh lighting. As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would ... | 4.0
The Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine | This is a gorgeous palette of eyeshadows that range from earth tone colors like sand and tan to red and gold hues characteristic of a sunset (hence the title). Most of them shimmer with glitter, which is really cool - you can mix and match the different colors to get just the right effect. No brush is included but it's easy enough to apply to your eyes with your fingers. The quality is pretty good - I didn't experience any eye irritation when I used this. Very nice gift for yourself or a friend. | 5.0
CLAIR BEAUTY Hyaluronic & Retinol Day Cream & Facial Serum Collection Gift Set - Hydrating, Rejuvenating & Anti Aging | Reduces Wrinkles & Fine Lines | Locks in Moisture, Smoothing & Evening Skin Tone | Considering it's low price point, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this set performed on my skin. I have dry patches on my cheeks and the moisturizer worked really well at keeping my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I didn't like the eye serum as much (I didn't see much of a difference) but it didn't irritate my skin so both products are decent for the price. | 4.0
Natural Jade Roller Massager & Rose Quartz Facial Roller 2pcs Gift Set | Jade facial rollers are everywhere these days and it's hard to find one that stands out among the crowded field of rollers. This set contains a beautiful rose pink quarter roller with two tiny bottles containing quartz crystals. I love the bottles but the downside is absolutely no instructions are given as how to use them. If you add essential oils, you usually need a carrier oil (like coconut) because they are not good for your skin if applied directly. I'm not sure how the crystals would mitiate this or not, as they're just little rocks. As a result, I'm not sure how to use these.<br /><br />The roller itself, however, is of good quality and I've been using it frequently. I would get it for the ... | 3.0
2 in 1 Hair Straightener and Curler Travel Curling Flat Iron Wand Crimper, Dual Voltage 110V-240V Ceramic Tourmaline 1 1/4 inch Portable | I just came back from a trip and packed this curling iron in my luggage. It's described as "travel" but the length is about the same as other curling irons. The main difference is the weight - it's so light and functions as both a straightener and curler, so it does save space in my luggage. It works very well. I had never heard of this brand before but the curler works just as well as more expensive brands. To change from a curler to a straightener, you simply press the buttons "S" for Straightener or "C" for Curling! So simple and easy to use. | 4.0
Beast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast | This is a strongly scented mens body wash with notes of ginseng, green tea, menthol and Vitamin B. Caffeine is also listed as an ingredient. The menthol and the ginseng scents overpower the rest. It lathers up very well and imparts a cooling sensation that makes you tingle all over and even clears your sinuses! I would recommend this body wash for people with colds because this really helps. I love it. | 5.0
12ML Refillable Perfume Atomizer Bottle for Travel Spray Scent Pump Case Pack of 5 | This is a multi-colored set of travel perfume atomizers. Each one is shaped like a fancy pen or lip gloss, which makes it easy to mistake it for one. However, each one is quite attractive and adds a touch of glamour to your purse. Each slender tube holds quite a bit of perfume. This is ideal for travel and would make a nice gift for the frequent traveler who can't live without her favorite perfumes. | 4.0
Vitabrid C12 Vitamin C face brightening powder - 12hours Transdermal, the Best professional Vitamin C complex and LDH help brighten and minimize fine lines/wrinkles through collagen synthesis | This is a small bottle of powder that comes with a tiny spoon. You dab a bit of the white powder into your hand and mix it with your regular moisturizer, which you then apply to your face. I used a little water and my usual Aveeno moisturizer with SPF 15 sunblock. My face does look a little brighter after using it for a week but the effect is somewhat similar to using a light-colored makeup foundation. Unfortunately it has little effect on my crow's-feet or my small &quot;laugh lines&quot;. It's OK but since I can get the same effect applying certain types of makeup or concealers, it's chief benefit is that it's good to use when you don't want to wear makeup and want something that ... | 3.0
Mountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads with 96% Acetone, for Natural Nails, 10 Count | UPDATED Review:<br />I took off one star because the tips of my nails turned yellow (and stayed that way for a few days) after using this product. Using ordinary nail polish didn't have that effect.<br /><br />Previously:<br />These are convenient for travel but I found that using one pad just isn't enough to remove the nail polish from both hands, especially if you have glitter or gel. When you rip open the packet, the cloth is heavily saturated with nail remover and when you unfold it it's about the size of one of those wet naps you get when you eat greasy food. I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed ... | 3.0

Aloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz) | This is a great Aloe Gel. I keep in the fridge and use it regularly. It’s light enough weight that it doesn’t feel goopy and washes off clean. Very thick, nice and cold from the fridge and it’s great for too much sun or too much kitchen (burns, cuts, grease spatters, etc.). Easy to use - no nasty smell and works. | 5.0
Mens Sea Facial Detox Facial Mask Sheet for Oily Skin- New Skincare - Blackhead, Pore Cleansing, Peel-off (Age under 35) | I wasn't really sure about this and when I first opened it I became even more skeptical. It looked like a paper towel and I had to wet it? Fortunately I thought ahead and opened it before soaking it in water and it was relatively easy to handle. I didn't love wearing it for 30 minutes, I got annoyed by then with the masque but 20 minutes was about my limit and I did see results. I liked the masque overall and it seemed to improve the tone and texture of my skin. I knocked off a point because it was a bit cumbersome to use and waiting around for 30 minutes seemed too much for me. I've got very sensitive skin and this was not of ... | 4.0
Simply Dana Rivitastore Neck Firming Cream — Skin Firming Cream for Tightening Neck, Jawline, and Chest, Collagen Peptides, and Squalane Cream for Wrinkles, Sagging, and Dryness | Seems to work but my neck definitely needs more help than I'll get from a cream. Moisturizes well and absorbs nicely. My sensitive skin didn't have any trouble. I did notice some improvement but it doesn't last through the day. | 4.0
Face Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape | There are a number of this type of product on the market and this one does not compare favorably to any others that I’ve tried. They don’t hold well and I didn’t notice any improvement. I’ll keep shopping. | 1.0
HWASHIN 12 Pack 3.4oz/100ml Clear Plastic Spray Bottles with White Fine Mist Sprayers for Essential Oils, Perfumes & Aromatherapy (Brush, Funnels, Droppers, Labels & 30ml Measuring Cup Included) | I travel a lot and find that using a mister for a lot of things makes it easier. The problem has always been that the bottles leak or don't mist. These work perfectly and don't leak! | 5.0
Nail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use | These work okay on natural nails but they don't seem to last as long as some of my older ones that are still in use years later. I generally only use them to touch up rough edges or file down broken nails but I couldn't swear to their durability. I can't imagine them working well on acrylics or gels but since I'm not using either right now I can only attest to the fact that they are working on my natural nails and seem to work okay I'm just not sure about their durability. | 4.0
Automatic Curling Iron, Rechargeable Cordless Hair Curler with LCD Digital Display and 6 Temperature Settings, Fast Heating Portable Automatic Hair Curler for Styling Hair Anytime ( Pink ) | While I love the idea of this, the actual product just isn't there yet. The charge didn't last long enough to get my hair done (I do have long and thick hair) so YMMV but the second time I tried to use it, it seems that the charge didn't even last as long as the first. Too much trouble for me. I was hoping for a true rechargeable product which would be excellent--if only this one delivered. | 1.0
JASSINS Face Highlight Stick, JASSINS 3D Dual Contour Stick, Shimmer Cream Powder, 2-in-1 Facial Brightens & Shades Foundation Concealer | Easy to use and blends well. The dark color was a little darker than I would have liked but that's a color issue. The lighter color works well. Does the job. | 4.0
Gnker Cellulite Remover Massager Brush Hair Mask 5 Seconds to Restore Soft Deep Conditioner Magical Hair Treatment Mask for Dry Damaged | Once I got comfortable using this, the hand part felt weird at first, I've seen decent results. I do use a cellulite gel and this brush and I can really see an improvement. I used the same combination a couple years ago and was very happy with my results but I fell by the wayside - I'm back and I'll continue to use it forever. Between the gel and the brush, the action of using the brush is the most important and I noticed results after a couple of weeks. | 4.0

GOGALLJUG Jade Roller and Gua Sha,100% Natural Jade Facial Body Eyes Neck Massager Tool Reduce Wrinkles Aging | This is a nice jade facial roller and Gua Sha. Both ends roll smoothly and the Gua Sha is smooth all around. I do wish the stone itself in both pieces felt even smoother, I can feel slight texture in the stones in some spots (it's just not as smooth as a rose quartz roller and Gua Sha that I have but maybe that's just the nature of the stone itself). Otherwise the stone does feel nice on my face especially when it's taken out of the fridge so it feels cool and refreshing. | 4.0
BEPHOLAN Facial Skin Massager For Slimming Firming Reduce Wrinkles and Skin Rejuvenate | This is a nice quality rose quartz facial roller. The massaging feature is nice and relaxing. There is a AA battery already installed (I didn't know that until I just happened to turn it on and it started vibrating). I wish the on/off was actually printed or engraved onto the handle. It's just a little gold sticker that could easily fall off if wet or from regular use. To remove/replace the battery you have to turn it to the "on" position and keep turning until the cap comes off. I wish the large roller actually rolled easily. The stone is smooth so it does glide over my skin nicely and with the vibration on, I can't even tell that the stone isn't actually rolling. The smaller stone ... | 4.0
BJÖRN HALL Button Knotted Nurse Headbands for Women with Buttons | Ear Saver Headband with buttons | Headband with Buttons for Face Mask for Nurses & Doctors | Elastic Hair Band with Buttons | Protect Your Ears with this Headband | Floral Blue | This is a cute twisted knot headband. The button placement is fine for my mask but it could easily be adjusted to your liking with some basic sewing skills. The fabric is soft and stretchy. I would've liked it to be slightly smaller to begin with because it does feel like it will get stretched out too easily with prolonged use. It is a bold pattern but with the mixed colors, it would be easy to coordinate with different scrubs. This definitely helps alleviate discomfort on your ears from wearing facemasks. | 4.0
BJÖRN HALL Nurse Headband with Buttons for Face Mask | Elastic Swimsuit Material, Smooth & Stretchy | Ear Saver Headband with Buttons | Perfect for Nurses, Doctors & Medical Students | This is a nice simple headband that's made out of stretchy swimsuit material. It is single layered so you won't get too warm wearing it. The part that goes behind the back of your head is narrower than the part that goes above your forehead. I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only ... | 4.0

Hairro Curly Ponytail Drawstring 18 Inch #12 Light Brown | It’s not great, but I also guess it’s not horrible. It tangles easily and the combs don’t really have a purpose and pokes you in the scalp.
