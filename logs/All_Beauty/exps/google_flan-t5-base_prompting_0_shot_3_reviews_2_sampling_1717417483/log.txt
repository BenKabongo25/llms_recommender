Mscoreray Hand Sanitizer Dispenser Touch Free Smart Sensor Hands Disinfectant Dispensers Office Kitchen Hospital Home 10oz/500ml | [[VIDEOID:d41df5bddef7c70a7fa3c241cc00a2d8]] So, I was so excited to review this item upon delivery but with the whole pandemic situation, my order of hand sanitizer was backed up. When my sanitizer came, it was loser than most hand sanitizers I'm use to but still a bit too thick for this dispenser. Find like liquid doctor office sanitizer for this or use plain ol' alcohol since it's actual liquid and hey it's pure sanitizer lol.<br /><br />I love that although liquid (do not use any kind of gel sanitizer) is BEST for this dispenser, it shoots out so sharp and strong that there is no leaking afterwards. You have to put in 4 AA batteries in order for it to work and barely tap the symbol on top to turn ... | 5.0

Jolia Hair Fashion Gorgeous Hairstyles Synthetic Short Curly Wavy Full Hair Wigs for Women Natural Look, Jet Black (D03) | I freaking love this wig!! The shedding is very minimal and it's just gorgeous. You do not need to do too much to it beside dip wash it when received, as you should ANY wig prior to using. Everyone loved this wig on my head and honestly I hate big hair but this was sexy. I got the D03 color/length. I am just a wig wearing beginning so I have been trying many wigs for fun and just new looks since I only wear my hair straight.<br /><br />My comment will not say verified purchase because I buy rushed products through a family member account since they have a prime membership. | 5.0

L'ANGE HAIR Argan-Infused Round Brush | Lightweight & Ergonomic Design | 53MM Tourmaline Ceramic Barrel | I found this round brush to be of high quality and easy to use. I sometimes suffer from pain in my wrists due to typing often and found that this brush didn’t bother my wrists at all. I have never used an Argan infused brush and I did feel a difference between this brush and one without Argan: I did see that my hair felt smoother and less frizzy. The price point is on the higher end, but I felt the quality was definitely worth it. | 5.0
[Upgrade] FUGACAL Hair Straightener Brush, 30s Fast Heating, 3 Temp Settings, Anti-Scald Design and 30mins Auto-Off, Bring You Ultra Straight Hair with Natural Shiny Look in Minutes | I am a habitual flat iron user and recently purchased a wet to dry heating tool/comb, but decided to take a chance on this straightening brush steamer: I must say: I am quite impressed with this apparatus. It took me a quick second to get in a groove of running it through my hair, but after a few times, it was pretty easy. The tension/pull is really good and I liked how it left my hair. My hair feels so smooth and I am pretty satisfied with how my hair turned out (after my first try)... | 5.0
Dry Weightless Hair Volume and Texture Spray | Dry Texture Spray for Hair | Texturizing Spray | Sulfate and Cruelty Free 244ml (7oz) | I have been trying products that gives your hair the “textured” look. I have used regularly during the Summer months and I found that it did add volume to my hair. It also doubles as a dry shampoo., as it absorbs oils from your hair. Lastly, I felt that the aerosol sprayed out the product with a good amount of strength, which is a plus for me. | 5.0

Hairro Curly Ponytail Drawstring 18 Inch #12 Light Brown | It’s not great, but I also guess it’s not horrible. It tangles easily and the combs don’t really have a purpose and pokes you in the scalp. It’s extremely heavy, & definitely has a synthetic look to it. But maybe add some baby powder or dry shampoo to get rid of the shine? | 2.0

Natural Waterproof Lash Mascara Black, 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash Mascara Makeup, Lengthening and Thick, No Clumping, Smudge-proof, Long-Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Makeup Kit Eye Lash | This is the best mascara I've ever tried!<br />I have sparse lashes and even with one coat of this mascara, they look dramatically thicker.<br />If I add another coat, I can hardly even believe these are MY eyelashes!<br />With other brands, I've had trouble removing waterproof mascaras, but this one stays on in the pool, but comes right off with my makeup remover wipes. The packaging was cool too. | 5.0
Facial Cleansing Brush, Sonic Ultrasonic Vibration Facial Brush, Red-light for Deep Cleaning, Discharge Makeup, Gentle Exfoliating, Blackhead Removing, Massaging with 3 Adjustable Modes and Speeds | I wasn't quite sure how to use this facial cleansing brush because the instructions were not clear. However, I came back to the product's site on Amazon and learned more.<br /><br />I love how my face feels after using this brush. I take mine right in the shower with me, and while I'm waiting for my shampoo or conditioner's time to be up, I use my facial cleanser, and use this brush to clean. It's great for removing make-up, (which I rarely wear), and brow liners.<br /><br />Afterwards, even prior to applying serums and/or moisturizers, my face feels refreshed and vibrant. I feel like I'm getting a deeper clean than with my fingertips or washcloths or even make up removal wipes. I also feel like my skin ... | 4.0
2Pcs Mascara Black Volume and Length 4D Natural and Long Lasting Lash Blast Mascara, 0.27 Fl Oz | My lashes are a bit sparse and a mascara that makes them look more full is like finding a unicorn,. But this time, I hit the jackpot. This review is of: Waterproof Mascara 2 Pcs Silicone Brush Head 4D Natural and Long Lasting Lash Blast Volume Mascara.<br /><br />I love this stuff. I can't deal with the whole false lashes thing, I don't do well with glues, and the magnetic ones don't seem to stay on well. When I tried this mascara I was hoping for fuller looking lashes and that's what I got! I do two coats and that does the trick for me. The brush is short so it's easier for me to apply as I seem to have more control, It's also a dense ... | 5.0

Blackhead Remover, Gahoroy Blackhead Vacuum Suction Remover, Electronic Pore Vacuum Cleaner, Acne Extractor Tool Set with LED Display for Facial Skin Treatment | So I was not sure what to expect when using this and I was happy with the results.<br />You definitely want to use steam to open your pores up first or you wont really see any results. As I was using this I was getting disappointed as I did not see it doing anything. The I looked at the ducking thing and there was stuff in there it got off my skin. Then the next morning my nose looked soo much better!!!<br />Every time I use this my face looks better and better, I wish I had taken before pictures!<br />Oh and start on the low setting cause wow does this thing have sucking power!!! | 4.0

OC Nails UV Shield Glove (BLACK NIGHT) Anti UV Glove for Gel Manicures with UV/LED Lamps | Best price on amazon for this type glove. I was concerned with the size because of all the reviews but bought them anyway because all the others were 30 bucks and I wasn't paying that for them. I wear a size 7 glove which is a large in ladies gloves, I wear a size 9 shoe and I'm 5'8&#34;....you may wonder why I told you that? Well, hands are relative to feet and height. My hand is just under 3 1/2 inches wide at its widest and these fit me perfect. Many people said they fit big and that worried me.

BJÖRN HALL Nurse Headband with Buttons for Face Mask | Elastic Swimsuit Material, Smooth & Stretchy | Ear Saver Headband with Buttons | Perfect for Nurses, Doctors & Medical Students | This is a nice simple headband that's made out of stretchy swimsuit material. It is single layered so you won't get too warm wearing it. The part that goes behind the back of your head is narrower than the part that goes above your forehead. I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only ... | 4.0
