Natural Waterproof Lash Mascara Black, 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash Mascara Makeup, Lengthening and Thick, No Clumping, Smudge-proof, Long-Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Makeup Kit Eye Lash | This is the best mascara I've ever tried!<br />I have sparse lashes and even with one coat of this mascara, they look dramatically thicker.<br />If I add another coat, I can hardly even believe these are MY eyelashes!<br />With other brands, I've had trouble removing waterproof mascaras, but this one stays on in the pool, but comes right off with my makeup remover wipes. The packaging was cool too.
Magnetic eyelashes with eyeliner，Beevila False Eyelashes Upgraded 5D Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit, fake eyelashes 5 Pairs with Tweezers, Easy to Wear,No glue! | When I saw these up for request on the Vine program, I decided to give them a shot. I recently started wearing makeup again, (and now have stopped, because...masks!), and since my eyes are all anyone sees all day, I thought these might look nice. This review is of: Magnetic eyelashes with eyeliner，Beevila False Eyelashes Upgraded 5D Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit, fake eyelashes 5 Pairs with Tweezers, Easy to Wear,No glue!.<br /><br />As I said above, I'm a newbie at these. I have had no other experience with them, so take my opinion with a grain of salt! I played around with these twice. The first time, I couldn't stand how they felt at the outer edges of my eyes. The liner was easy to put ...
35.4 Inch Extra Long Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower, 2021 Updated Lengthen Back Scrubber Brush for Men and Women, Exfoliating Back Washer with Wall Hooks, Easy Clean, Comfortable Massage (Green 27.5in) | It seems like I've had an itch in the upper and middle part of my back for months now. It's just so irritating!<br /><br />I requested this product in the hopes it would help me out and it has. I basically use my loofah to apply suds to the scrubby side, then it's just a matter of figuring out where to place your hands so that you reach your trouble areas. I like screaming hot showers, but I know they help to dry out my skin. I can combat that with lotion and loofahs, but it's hard to loofah the center part of your back, you know?<br /><br />The other side of this scrubber is for a massage type feel, but I wasn't digging that as much ...
KLAVUU Pure Pearlsation pH Balancing Quick Cleansing Pad 100ea - Powerful Makeup Mild Exfoliating Cleansing Pad without Skin Irritation, Intense Moisturizing | Having recently started wearing makeup again, I found myself in need of a really good makeup remover. That is why I requested KLAVUU Pure Pearlsation pH Balancing Quick Cleansing Pad 100ea - Powerful Makeup Mild Exfoliating Cleansing.<br /><br />What I like most about these pads is their size. They are really big, especially as compared to...almost every other makeup remover pads out there. I mean, they're really big. Also, there's a lot of fluid in this jar. With some pre-moistened pads that I've tried, I've found that they dry out, halfway through the container. What a ripoff, because they're not cheap! With these, there's so much fluid there's extra on the bottom. I have no doubt that the bottom pads will have just as much fluid in ...
Facial Cleansing Brush, Sonic Ultrasonic Vibration Facial Brush, Red-light for Deep Cleaning, Discharge Makeup, Gentle Exfoliating, Blackhead Removing, Massaging with 3 Adjustable Modes and Speeds | I wasn't quite sure how to use this facial cleansing brush because the instructions were not clear. However, I came back to the product's site on Amazon and learned more.<br /><br />I love how my face feels after using this brush. I take mine right in the shower with me, and while I'm waiting for my shampoo or conditioner's time to be up, I use my facial cleanser, and use this brush to clean. It's great for removing make-up, (which I rarely wear), and brow liners.<br /><br />Afterwards, even prior to applying serums and/or moisturizers, my face feels refreshed and vibrant. I feel like I'm getting a deeper clean than with my fingertips or washcloths or even make up removal wipes. I also feel like my skin ...
Anon Make Up Remover Wipes 100ct | Individually Wrapped Natural Vitamin E and Aloe Vera | Bamboo Mini Makeup Wipes | AirBnB’s Choice for Convenient Single Use Face Wipes | Paraben and Alcohol Free | This review is for: Anon Make Up Remover Wipes 100ct<br /><br />These arrived in a taped and twisted up plastic bag. It was a bit of a bear to even get the darn thing open to access the wipes. Once it's open, you'll probably need to find another container to put all these wipes in.<br /><br />The wipes themselves are individually packaged, which is nice because the ones that come in the package that supposedly reseals but doesn't? Those dry out FAST.<br /><br />These are great if you're going to be traveling and want to toss some in your cosmetic bag without taking up a bunch of room. They're a bit small though and a few times I had to use more than one to get all ...
Eyebrow Stencil ,Eyebrows Grooming Stencil Kit Reusable Styling Tool with 1 Eyebrow Pencil (8pcs Eyebrow stencils（new style）) | I’m new to the Vine program and hopefully I’ll be more discerning when requesting items in the future.<br /><br /> As far as I’m concerned this is junk. It’s cheap plastic and flimsy. Look at the directions above, (I assume those are directions, but I’m not positive because I can’t read them), what is even happening there? In the second picture is she thinking? Is she winking? What is going on here? The elastic piece which I thought went around my head was too small and wouldn’t stay on.<br /><br />At this point I dropped a stencil, and because I wasn’t wearing my glasses, (hard to wear them when working on your eyebrows), I promptly stepped on it and broke it. By this time I was so ...

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Good hold, workable wax. It has a slight pleasant scent and I like that you can turn the nozzle in two directions to get the spray pattern you prefer depending on the style you are looking for.
Has a nice scent and texture, it’s easy to use and it helps me get my hair look amazing
This is the waxiest and the most stickiest hair spray I've ever used. I touched my hair by accident and had to wash my hand, because it made my hand sticky. If I use this hair spray everyday then I have to wash my hair everyday too. After spraying this on my hair, it made it look like I didn't wash my hair for two weeks. It doesn't smell good either. I don't like this spray at all.
Love this stuff ! I have very course type 3c curly hair and this stuff helps my frizz and flyaways lay down. It works better than any hairspray and doesn’t build up in my hair
I am trying to train my short hair to go over my ear while I what for it to grow longer. gpt2b glued spray wax has worked wonderfully. There is no scent and the spray is light so you don't feel it . The spray top has two nozzles - one for flexible texture and one for a structured hold (which is the one I am using now). It holds my hair in place for about 4 hours and then my strands of my hair starts to come out and escape from behind my ear. All I have to do is dampen the palm of my hand with a little water and run my hand over the hair and it goes right back to where I want ...
I use the got2b freeze spray to style all my wigs so I thought I’d give this a try! I like how it holds and allows me to style spikes easier. It doesn’t leave as much of that crunchy feeling like too much of the freeze spray does. It’s not as strong of a hold as the freeze spray, but it works great for what it’s for.
Got 2 Be works good at securing wig. Spray is easy to use and does not damage skin when removing. Washing out of hair easily.

The item description is Got2b Glued Spray Wax with 2-in-1 Dual Nozzle, 8 oz. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: The last time I was at the hair salon, my stylist used spray wax on my hair and I was amazed by it. Never having heard of spray wax before and loving the hold that it gave my hair, when I saw this available for request on Vine, I asked for it. This review is of: Got2B Glued 2in1 Spray Wax, translucent, 8 Ounce.<br /><br />Being that this is an entirely new product for me, it took me a few tries to get just the right amount to hold my hair back from frizzing and flying away, but I did find it. I like this better than hair spray because it doesn't make my hair crunchy while still keeping my style. I do sometimes have some flyaways near the end of the day, so I don't know if the hold fades or what exactly is happening, but 9 hours of hold is pretty good. I am considering buy more of this when I empty this bottle.

Anti Aging Facial Masks by ERH with Intensive Care Serum to Help Reduce the Appearance of Fine Lines and Wrinkles. New Version Exclusive to Amazon with Expanded Mask Coverage. 5-Mask Pack | My daughter and I discovered facial sheet masks over the summer and have become fans of them. They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This ...
AuroTrends Makeup Remover Towel,2 Pack Reusable Chemical-free Microfiber Makeup Remover Cloths,Magically and Gently Wipe Away Cosmetics,Sunscreen,Oil and Dirt,Set of 2 (Pink+Black) | I have one of the original Makeup Erasers and to be honest, I can't tell the difference between these cloths or the original one. Well, that's not entirely true, I can tell the difference. These have a hanging loop and the name brand ones don't! Side by side, they are identical. These are just as soft. They do an impressive job of removing makeup, especially mascara. They are gently on my skin. These come in a set of 2, plus the set is half the price of the original. I will be ordering some of these for the girls in my life!
BEST Sleep Mask Set - Super Soft Silk Eye Mask For Traveling Insomnia And Meditation + Ear Plugs And Pouch | I sleep better when I wear a sleep mask, so I use them regularly. When I was looking for a new one to replace my worn out one, I was given the opportunity to purchase this one at a discounted price so I could try it out. This is a nice, light weight sleeping mask. I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at ...
Pure Rosehip Seed Oil Certified Organic Large 4 Ounce Bottle (120 Ml) By Jarosa Beauty - Cold Pressed, Virgin & Unrefined, Carrier, Face & Hair Oil - No Fillers or Fragrance | First of all, this is a generous amount of rosehip oil! I've been using it daily for about 2 weeks and I've barely put a dent in it. I've been using it on a burn scar that I have on my arm. The pump lid is easy to use & dispenses a nice amount of oil. One pump is enough for my scar. When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears. It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me. I've been keeping it on my nightstand and applying it at bedtime. If it left my hands feeling sticky or greasy, I would ...
Scrub Angel Organic Arabica Coffee Body Scrub 8oz. An exfoliator that leaves Skin Smooth and Soft while Reducing Cellulite, 100% Natural Treatment | I love coffee scrubs. This one is a new favorite. There are two types of body scrubs. Dry ones that are like sand and don't clump together or ones that have a lot of oil that cause it to clump together. This one is a dry one. It comes with a little scoop which is nice. My last dry coffee scrub that I had did not, so it actually was a bit messy to use. The directions say to scrub it on your skin and leave for a few seconds before rinsing. Most coffee scrubs that I have tried say to leave it on for a few minutes which I find to be nearly impossible unless you turn the water off. The smell is amazing - a ...
Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | My daughter received a UV Light Manicure Light last year for Christmas from her aunt. It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To ...
zh-er-0424-dv684 | I am in my late 40's and always looking for new skin care products to help reduce the signs of aging, so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this serum at a discounted price in order to try it out, I was more than happy to do so. It is the first face serum that I have tried that has absolutely no scent or fragrance. It's a very thin consistency, like water. It took a couple of uses to figure out that I can't just pump a little bit on to my finger because it just rolls off. The absorption rate is pretty quick which I like. It's frustrating when you have to wait a few minutes for a serum to absorb into you skin ...

Here are some examples of other users' reviews for the item:
Just for the feel good sensation from rolling the cool jade rollers over the face, this would be worth the cost.<br />The relief of puffiness around the eyes is a bonus. This leaves the face feeling refreshed and stimulated<br />The Gua Sha is also easy to use and leaves the face feeling lovely and smooth.
UPDATE: I still don't know how long this will last, but 2 months in I love this roller (store it in my freezer and use it every day), so I'm upgrading to 5 stars from 4.<br /><br />This jade roller manages to feel cool almost any time of day, which is great for reducing puffiness. It looks precisely as pictured, and comes with a storage bag and sweet uplifting note (unexpected and appreciated, even though I know everyone gets one). **If** it were a paint roller (and it's not), I wouldn't be entirely happy with how smoothly it rolls--it's decent but feels like the bearings could be a bit more reliable--but I'm not planning to subject it to heavy-duty work and even if it wobbles the tiniest ...
This is a really nice product for the price. In comparing prices, this came with a lot of amenities that the other products did not include. The packaging was top notch, It is nicely made and makes my face feel amazing in the morning.
This Jade face roller and Jade Gua Sha tool comes packaged nicely. This roller is a little nicer than the last one I reviewed, therefore the reason for the 5 start. We enjoy using this one more than our other one. This is better put together and seems to be a grade or two better.
This is a well.made<br />Jade roller and Gua sha with good instructions and nice packaging in a box with a cloth bag, this would be a five star but I hate and despise that the company name is engraved on both the roller handle and the gua sha . this makes the tools uncomfortable to hold and restricts the comfort and freedom.of movement of the gua sha.
I wasn’t sure what to expect with Spa Grade Jade Roller for Face with Gua Sha | Jade Face Roller Massager | Jade Facial Roller | Face Roller Massager | Jade Rollers | Wrinkle Roller. It is much smaller than I expected, though it needs to be for the face. It’s easy to use, and feels really good. It seems to be of good quality. I don’t believe a stone holds any kind of power, but I do believe that massaging increases circulation, which helps to improve our overall look.<br /><br />About the product<br />• Jade Facial Massager: Jade face roller comes with Jade Gua Sha tool. Gua Sha facial tool is used for gentle face massage of the skin (without breaking the skin) to get the ...
I had a hard time believing the only other review of this product. She made it sound so easy and non-hurtful. My opinion may be jaded because I am old Senior Citizen and have had all the little hurts to fill a lifetime diary. Maybe hurt is the wrong word.....maybe the right word is JUST different than I anticipated. I also do not feel educated in things like this well enough to do something to my face.<br /><br />However, I asked all the other retirees in the dining room today and some said their daughters/granddaughters had used something like this and thought it worked wonders. Unfortunately, I can't use their statements....only my own.<br />And for me. I just didn't like it enough to continue doing it again.

The item description is Spa Grade Jade Roller for Face with Gua Sha | Jade Face Roller Massager | Jade Facial Roller | Face Roller Massager | Jade Rollers | Wrinkle Roller. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I have been using jade rollers for the past few months. This is my third one. The first one that I bought was much larger than this and I found it to be a bit awkward at times. Plus the end that rolls around the eyes was a static piece, not a roller. Then I tried a smaller one more recently. It was fine, until the eye roller piece broke off. The metal piece that holds it in never felt really sturdy and when it broke, I wasn't really surprised. This one is the nicest one I've tried. It's a great quality and very sturdy. The size is perfect. The directions say to chill it in the refrigerator, but I have found that it's usually cold enough just leaving it out on my bathroom counter. I use it primarily to help my serums and creams absorb into my skin better. This comes with another tool, a Gua Sha, which I was unfamiliar with. They both were in a nice drawstring bag and would be perfect for gift giving.

I've owned Sonicare toothbrushes for over ten years. I even own the latest and greatest DiamondCare toothbrush now. I buy these expensive toothbrushes because my teeth stain terribly and I get terrible tartar. Only these toothbrushes can spare my teeth most of the harm.<br /><br />I noted the following differences/similarities between the Sonicare and the Panasonic Sonic toothbrush:<br />1. Both have long battery life so the toothbrushes don't need to be recharged for days at a time.<br />2. Both reduce tartar and stain much, much more than standard toothbrushes.<br />3. Both have various settings on it--but honestly, I just use the regular setting each time.<br />4. The Panasonic Sonic toothbrush feels lighter than the Sonicare but I haven't weighed both separately to confirm this fact.<br />5. The ...
The Panasonic is very small body tooth brush. It has 3 settings accessed by sequentially pushing the Mode button for white, soft and sensitive. The white is the most vigorous.the software reduces the vibrations and the sensitive modulates the vibration at a 1/2 second rate. I dont see the advantage of ever using any mode that isnt full on. It came with a small carrying case so the Panasonic would easily fit into a small purse. The brush is easily detached. It came with a 2 of brush attachments for gum massage and a small stand to hold them. I compared it to my existing Sonicare and the Panasonic is much less vigorous in it movement and seems to stall easier when pressed against suggesting the motor ...

The item description is Panasonic EW-DL82 Sonic Vibration Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I don't see the fuss with this toothbrush. As was mentioned in other reviews, it is smaller and more lightweight than other rechargeable toothbrushes. But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean. As an fyi, I stopped using it this morning and went back to my Phillips.

Mr. Pristine Organic Beard Conditioner to Grow, Thicken, Moisturize and Protect Your Beard, 8.5 oz. | I would give it 2 stars but I actually like the (opposite) effect it had on my beard. It ended up drying out my beard but gave it a fuller effect. The conditioner itself is a thick lotion like consistency, very hard to squeeze out. Scent is a light spearmint that doesn't transfer to my beard well. Disappears after rinsing. End effect left my beard and face feeling dry and chapped, not what I want from a conditioner.
MD Complete Bright & Healthy Vitamin C+ Vitalizing Face Serum| with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Herbal Extracts | Potent Antioxidant Protection, Nourishes, Brightens and Evens Skin 0.5 fl oz | First, the scent is AMAZING...Sweet blood orange with a grapefruit bubble gum undertone, maybe even some jasmine and peppermint, something that awakens your olfactory. Its very strong but not overpowering. Truly one of the best things I've smelt.<br /><br />APPLICATION: Goes on fairly oily and blends pretty well. Immediately brings color to my face, I have medium skin and it starts with an apricot redness but fades back to an awakened tone. I really enjoy that about this, I see others complain about this so maybe it's not best for fair skinned people?.<br /><br />Once dry, I am left with a matte sheen that is well hydrated. You expect it to feel oily but it's more like a raw feel. A really nice balance of hydrated but ...
ZOUSZ Black Oud Vegan Beard Balm - Classic Wood-Scented Facial Hair Grooming and Skin Care Butter for Men - Avocado, Argan, Macadamia Oils - Vegan Moisturiser, Conditioner, and Dandruff Remover | If you're a cologne guy, this is more for you...It's strong enough you probably don't have to wear cologne with it. Scent starts off as clean laundry, then comes a little cedar spice, ending with a sweet vanilla...Combined for what I personally wouldn't call "manly" but more of a "man who is trying to smell good"... Has a designer fragrance to it, a little body spray but a bit more classy.<br /><br />Performance is okay. The balm is very fluffy ad soft like coconut butter. It doesn't tame as much as I like but softens and gives a nice glow.<br /><br />Overall I want to hate on this but just can't... I can see why some might hate the cologne smell, it's quite strong and different from ...
AZURE Hyaluronic & Retinol Anti Aging Under Eye Pads- Moisturizing & Rejuvenating Eye Mask Patches - Reduces Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Dark Circles & Puffiness - Skin Care Made in Korea - 5 Pairs | Pretty straight forward. Come 2 to a sealed pouch. They are stacked in the pouch so they can be a little difficult to get apart and straightened out. No noticeable or standout scent to them. Apply smooth, nice that they have slits so you can shape it to your contour. They do a nice job refreshing and smoothing my eyes.
3 Barrel Curling Iron, 25mm Curling Waver Iron Hair Waver with LCD Display Adjustable Temperature 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Triple Hair Crimper Hair Tools for Deep Waves All Style (1#) | Really nice iron! 5 stars based off of it's value at a $35 price point. Is it a top of the line, 5 star iron? No...But for this price, it is an excellent value for an entry level device. The handle is very ergonomic with an on/off button with +/- temperature control. It heats up quick enough, giving you a temp readout on the LCD display. The iron itself is a little thin and somewhat cheaply painted but it functions nicely. The clasp opens and closes with ease but has good retention. My wife was unsure if she'd like one of these and she is very happy with it and it's results!
Automatic Hand Soap/Sanitizer Dispenser Kit - Table liquid Dispenser Pump Station 13.5 oz. Alcohol-Based Sprayer | **update** Unit stopped working after a few days. New (and tested) batteries placed in it and it won't power on. The second part, which is my original review stands true...However, I can not longer give a good rating to a product that lasted a couple days. Your results may vary.<br /><br />Nice little dispenser. Good goldielocks size, not too big, not too small. Doesn't get in the way but doesn't get overlooked. Sanitary design and functions well.
10 Magnets Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner, LANKIZ Exclusive 3x Stronger 1mm Ultra-Light Magnets, 5D Magnetic Lashes Pack Natural Look with 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliner Kit & Unique Applicator Tool | My wife is pretty happy with these. Nice aesthetics, decent magnets...Trick is to find the right amount of liner, it requires a good amount for a strong cling but not a crazy amount.

"Best shave I've ever had. Gives me a close shave with no tugging. Better than an electric razor".<br /><br />That's the first thing my husband had to say after he tested SUPRENT's Matrix Cutter Head travel kit razor for the first time. And what a kit this is. A razor handle, 2-blade refills (each with the first of its kind 6 ultra-thin blades total!), a dock to hold the razor and a bottle of shaving foam are included.<br /><br />The handle is sleek and heavy but easy and comfortable to hold. The head doesn't pivot but it doesn't need to thanks to the 38.5 degree shaving angle. It glides perfectly along the jaw line and chin areas without missing a spot.<br /><br />The base is heavy-ish and ...
This is one of those products what tries to wow you with great packaging and high quality materials. Seriously, the packaging for this thing is better than a $450 watch I got recently. It's top notch.<br /><br />RAZOR HANDLE - C<br />This thing is so heavy it borders on ridiculous. It's solid metal. If you dropped it on your foot, it would hurt. It feels good in your hand until you try to use it. There are no good grip points and the entire thing is smooth. Once it gets wet, it's a nightmare to hold and use.<br /><br />BLADES - A<br />The blades are some of the best you'll find. Super close shave and they last a number of shaves. You really can't beat them.<br /><br ...
This is nice looking kit with good shaving cream. Only complaint is I wish the razors you could buy in the store and pop them in versus ordering online and having them shipped.
This is a really neat razor that has one possible issue, which I'll get to later.<br /><br />The handle is big and heavy, and its unusual shape is very stylish. It gives a nice shave, too. If you have a small face or tight features, the large head might be a bit tricky to use in some areas, but that hasn't been a major issue. I usually use an old-school double-edge razor, not a flexing cartridge razor, so the fixed head angle isn't an issue for me. If you're used to a razor with a movable head, this one might take some getting used to.<br /><br />The included shaving foam smells good and works well. You don't get a lot, but you don't have to use a ...
Not a dude but I have plenty of curves so I can testify to how well these work on curves and because of the shape of these they are easy to use on all curves. They have 6 blades and glide effortlessly through even thick hair. Did a great job on shaving large areas and has a nice weight to it so its easy to hold.

The item description is SUPRENT Razors for Men with Matrix Cutter Head, 38.5° Golden Angle Shaving Kit for Men, Travelling Razor Kit-1 Mens Razor Handle, 2 Blade Refills,1 Dock,1 Shave Foam. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: This is a tough one to review...Works great on my neck and face but not so great on my bald head. The ergonomics are fantastic, it's a hefty metal body with nice curves. The blade nestles in the top groove with metal surrounding it...This makes for a difficult close shave from my bald head curves, I like to press down harder and get a close shave but the surrounding metal prevents that from happening. However, on my neck and cheeks, it does well, particularly with a dry shave.<br /><br />The foam is nice but nothing special. Doesn't slick up great but has a nice scent. The holder is okay...Sturdy but holds the blade loosely. Also, as of now, I don't see where I can get replacement blades.

Output: Great for beginners.

lorelo 20 pieces Hair Curlers, Hair Rollers Spiral Curls Styling Kit No Heat Hair Curlers with Styling Hooks for Girls Woman | I choose these because I've seen these before product curls without the heat and it was as simple as applying them and letting your hair air dry. Well let me tell you it takes alot of practice and patience and knowing what your doing. Is it simple enough to understand, yes. However the sectioning hair, getting tangled, knotted or stuck was alot of the problems I ran into. If my husband had not been home I think I might have been in some real trouble. I'm not mild tempered and almost was pulling my hair out trying to get it unstuck at some points. I will say there were times when I got a rhythm going and I was getting my hair to go thru effortlessly but ...

Target: • Lathers really well<br />• Has a light mint smell<br />• Leaves your beard feeling nice and clean afterwards<br /><br />Got for my husband as he is moving into grooming and managing his growing beard. He has told me that he really likes the way this shampoo cleans his beard and the fact that it lathers well without having to apply much product which for me is a win cuz that means less money spent in the long run. Overall he has def enjoyed using this product and we're still gauging if this is something we would repurchase but if we did it would def be because it's long lasting.

My wife has been using these lip liners and brought back the following feedback:<br /><br />These liners are a great value for the money. While many standard liners can cost $5-$6, these are $8-$9 for 12. The color selection is fantastic.<br /><br />However, the liners do not last as long as the better brands and the caps come off a little easier. That said, we would definitely recommend them and will purchase them again.
I tried each one of these lip liners and they are not true to the colors on the pencils. I like how vibrant the colors are and how smoothly the liner goes on. Paired with a lipstick, they look really nice and work well. I just wish that the color was accurate. Other than that, great product!
This set of lip liners are a great set of Reds - and the colors are great. The only problem for me was that they are a little hard which means sometimes they are a little scratchy and harder to get the perfect lines. For the price though you are getting a good selection with pretty much any shade of Red liner you could need.
Like most reviewers, the prospect of 12 lip liners was too tempting to pass up. I use soft crayon liners, or a brush of my lipstick, to create an one-the-spot liner all the time - so this seemed like a great buy.<br /><br />These are clearly imported. The good news is the manufacturer actually lists the ingredients on the box; I've taken a photo of the box so you can see the ingredients - personally, I don't recommend using products where you can't see the ingredients before you order.<br /><br />The pencils you get are an interesting range, and seem to vary from package to package. Mine were in a variety of colors; the one color I was looking for - a basic nude - was not ...

This is great. It is easy to use and works great. It is very easy to use. You just shake it out of the container. And then you don't see a bunch of skin with nothing on it. Works great and it is easy. And when you shower, it is going to wash out of your hair. And then you are ready for the next time you want to cover thinning areas. Follow all directions.

I had my daughter help me put these in. We both watched videos and are still discussing the pros and cons. Now, I am not sure how you are supposed to brush near your scalp with these in, so I will need to watch a video for that too. If I decide not to use them on my head, then I will use them to make a wig for my bjd collectibles. If I do use them on my hair, after the tape has had its full life then I will find something to do with these. They are going to be used, one way or ...
BeautyBio GloPRO Attachment Heads | The needles in the eye microtip are not very long and they are very thin, so it is a breeze to go over your eye area and eyebrow area without pain and with ease. I want all of the needling attachment heads. These are the best I have used to date.

My girlfriend has many gel nail polish, but this new set she says is her favorite, especially the green-lime color. The set also has other 7 different colors which are beautiful and rare as well. The gel works as supposed to. The brushes inside the bottles are nice and have good quality. So far so good. I will update my review if the quality decreases depending on the days used like shown on this picture. Happy customer!!
😀OMG!!!! These colors are to die fore. I love nudes with the greens adds that WOW factor, they are so vibrant and goes very smooth, like butta. And it comes with base&top coat along with 6 earth tone colors.
These colors are perfect for the fall season. They come in a really nice gift set package and include a bas and top coat so your giftee will be all ready to go...as long as they already have a lamp ;) The colors on the bottles are very accurate as to what is inside the bottle, which is really good considering a lot of the time color accuracy is the biggest issue. I swatched one color; it was two coats of perfection. The formula is a lot like regular polish rather than gel, meaning it glides on really well and you don't have to manipulate it to get good coverage. The top coat cured in 30 seconds which I was super excited about. Some other brands I ...
These gel polish colors are so pretty and unique. The polish works great and lasts. Use it with a UV light and you are set!
I like it very much. Specially the green color are perfect for Christmas.I like doing nail at home. Can‘t wait to put it on! :)
OMG , this is my favorite color set, I can’t wait to use it once I got them! It’s perfect color also very easy to use. Perfect finished shining look. I like it!

LAGEE Premium Flat Ellipse Eyelash Extensions Matte Black 0.12mm D curl 13mm Mixed Faux Mink Lash Individual Classic Split Tip Professional Lashes Supplies | These are great ones to learn with. They are already just to set in place. They have adhesive already. You just pick one with the tweezers and set it where you want it on your eyelashes. This is going to be my practice set to get used to using other kinds.
GERMAINE DE CAPUCCINI - Timexpert SRNS Repair Night Progress Serum - Advanced Anti-Ageing Booster with an Innovative Active Ingredient That Increases 8 Times the Power of Absorption - 1.7 oz | but I found the directions. When I was opening this, I noticed that the cellophane was covering a box that is in a sleeve. The outer sleeve is different in very small ways and looks more costly than the inner box. Anyway, the directions say to apply to clean skin before the night cream. I should see results in 8 days. It went on nicely and it is a nice sized bottle for drops.
Gel UV Nail Lamp, AsperX 150W LED Nail Dryer Gel Nail Polish Light Curing Lamp Kit Smart Auto-sensing with 10/30/60/99s Timer | My current gel/uv dryer takes a bit of time to cure my nails. I am trying this one which is 150 watt. Lots of difference than my old one.
Biutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED | When you read the directions on this, you will see you need a base coat - that is not included in this set. So you will need to use your own base coat for gel nails. Not an issue. Then you apply your black polish, then the glitter. Make sure you use your UV/LED lamp between steps to cure.
Dip Powder Nail Starter Kit 8 Colors Acrylic Dipping Powder System for French Nail Manicure Nail Art Set, Portable Kit for Trave, No LED Nail Lamp Needed… | The girl needs more dip colors, so she will get this set. It comes with eight dip colors, tools for cuticles and for filing, and it also comes with a base coat, an activator, top coat, liquid brush cleaner for the base coat, activator and top coat and a nice nail brush to brush off excess dip powder. .

I only have to play with the temperature gauge so that my thin hair doesn't burn off.

Beautiful extensions. Super soft and silky
The packaging of the hair clip extension was nice. I like that the package included a set of 3D eye lashes. The hair feels soft to the touch. It is straight forward to apply the extension. I like it because it gives a more natural look.
I’ve had the opportunity to test out several different brands of clip in extensions and this is definitely one of the thicker ones, if not the thickest. The hair has a nice density. It’s soft and silky and I could finger comb it no problem. Healthy hair with nice ends. True 1B. Very nice hair.

JUNOVEM COLE Spirulina Shampoo Spirulina + Aloe Vera, 8.5 fl. oz. Superfood Shampoo For Men & Women, Nutrient-rich hair loving ingredients | This shampoo did the near impossible and managed to dry out my fine, very oily hair. I don't care for it all, because it is way too harsh.
Coppertone Kids Clear Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50, Water Resistant Sunscreen for Kids, #1 Pediatrician Recommended Sunscreen Brand, Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50, 5 Fl Oz Tube | This sunscreen is nice. It's clear, absorbs well, and is free of nasty/questionable ingredients. However, it probably isn't best for the face since it leaves a shiny appearance. Still, it's perfect for the body, and my kids loved the blue color. It does go on completely clear.
Livordo Moroccan Argan Oil Essential Organic Cold Pressed Skin Moisturizer Rich in Vitamin E Powerful Antioxidants For Skin, Hair, Body, and Face 4 Oz | This is very nice argan oil that comes in a generous 4 oz size. I like applying this directly to my face and body or making my own oil blends. It's very good quality.
FULL SPECTRUM BODY OIL, Organic Blend of Marula, Lavender, Cedarwood, Ylang Ylang, MCT Coconut with Vitamin E, for Dry Skin, Scalp, Face, Hands, & Nails for Women MADE FRESH | I love using body oils, but I always end up with oil marks on my clothing. I was drawn to this because it claimed to be ultralight. As it turns out, it is pretty light, but you should wait at least 5 mins before putting on clothing. I accidentally used too much on my legs and had to wipe some of it off. Still, it is 100% natural, comes in a nice package, and smells sweetly of lavender. Would make a nice gift, but don't expect it to sink in immediately.
Portable Travel Bottles Set, 3oz Silicone Travel Size Toiletries Containers, Leakproof, Foldable, Squeezable, Refillable, TSA Carry On for Shampoo Lotion Soap cosmetic (Pack of 2) | I am the sort of people who would rather decant my usual beauty products into travel-size containers vs buying sample sizes. These silicone ones are nice, seem like they will last a long time, and best of all they comply with TSA requirements. I am very pleased with these and even use them for my gym bag.
Mountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 16 Fluid Ounce | This product does exactly what is supposed to do and takes off all the nailpolish. (It removed mine in just one go which is a plus.) I also like that it comes in a 16 oz. container since that means it will last awhile.

This Vitamin Brightening Ampoule by BE PLAIN is just ok in my eyes. It is pretty much scentless so that is boring but it does come in a beautiful frosted little dropper bottle. The serum is however just ok.<br /><br />The serum is fairly lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. The downside with it however is it leaves your skin tacky and that feeling fades but never really fully goes away. There is always a bit of that tacky residue on your skin. I did not notice any significant brightening effects either so it did not come through on that promise either.<br /><br />All in all this is just ok to be honest. I didn't really like how my face felt and it didn't really brighten ...
This is second product of theirs have tried. I have very reactive skin. These have never caused me redness nor caused any irritation. They go on smooth and light.
So good. Normally, the vitamin serum is dry after being applied, but this is not the case.
I’ve been using this with the other beplain Cicaful ampoule. The other one calms my skin down while this one makes my skin more bright. I probably need to use it longer to better results but so far of using it for a week my skin is better.
I've always loved beplain's product and wanting more of other product to come out and this appeared! I have acne scars that needs to go away lol after using this for like a week now, I can see my skin is little brighter. Can't wait to see the result after finishing a whole bottle!! Love it!
I absolutely love this serum. My skin is super sensitive and whenever I use any serum, I break out or my skin will react to it. Ever since I purchased this product, it had made my skin so much better. To the point where my friends would ask me what product I used. It has helped me a lot with my acne scarring and redness.<br />I’m definitely going to repurchase this once I’m done with the first bottle.
This product is moisturizing. I added yo my daily skin routine after toner. So far would recommend this product.

Lesentia Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 31 – Tinted Moisturizer For Face With Spf and Blemish Concealer with All Natural Ingredients like Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and Zinc* (Medium - 2fl oz) | i wanted to like this but i can't. it has coverage like a light coverage foundation but too dark in color, if you are very tan yes the color would work. i can't believe this is a "moisturizer" because it is super thick and sticky, it feels so heavy on the skin, it doesn't set or feel dry after unless you powder it. i can work with the color, i just don't like how this feels, your skin will feel warm and sticky. it's a shame because there is a lot in the bottle. if you want this for the coverage, might as well buy a bottle of foundation.
12ML Refillable Perfume Atomizer Bottle for Travel Spray Scent Pump Case Pack of 5 | [[VIDEOID:a3d7f3db939833c254ff74281c0dde18]] with the corona virus thing, i ordered this to fill with alcohol instead. i carry one in all my coat pockets and pocketbooks, so that i can spray my hands. the size is just right. you can't use up a whole thing of alcohol if went out in public. impressed with how pretty they are too. they are easy to figure out. the colors are just jackets -- you pull off the cap and the bottom so that you can unscrew the sprayer and fill it up. very good sprayer as well. not mad. i am happy.
Mountain Falls Regular Dip-It Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails, with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 9 Fluid Ounce | i love the convenience and ease of use. just dip your finger in the hole and it erases the polish like it never happened. it is potent stuff. it's basically just remover with a foam soaked inside with a bunch of incisions that you can insert your nails in. no complaints except that you will taste the fume (bitter) when you first open it. just keep it away from nose.
BYS Kabuki Brush | It's smaller than expected. I thought it would be bigger because of the price. Is is a very soft brush and good for blending powder and buffing because it's not scratchy, I hate scratchy brushes. It's good to travel with. It also sheds a little bit at first washing.

I use this for deep conditioning, hot oil treatments in my hair and it works marvelously!! I take about a half dollar size amount, heat it up slightly and apply throughout my hair before sitting with a processing cap. Definitely reduces frizz and strengthens the follicle!
This Argan oil is just above around in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes. I know Argan oil is not cheap but this does seem a bit overpriced. I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct. It does feel nice on your skin and absorbs pretty quickly but does leave a slight oily feel behind for a short time and that does disappear. At that point my skin felt nice but there are other products I have that make my ...
I am surprised by how much I love this! I've been using argan oil off and on for about two or two and a half years from another company. The other company, however, was getting too expensive for me, so I was excited when I saw this brand to try. Granted, the bottle is small at only 2 ounces, but it's still a decent price for pure argan oil.<br /><br />And the oil itself!! Totally true as the label reads. The oil is very lightweight and delicate feeling, much lighter than the oil I had been using, and it feels wonderful! I it primarily on my face and particularly around my eyes. It's so delicate that it feels really nice to use, like I'm giving myself a ...
I usually purchase this product quite often. But this time, it had a weird vegetable oil like texture that had no smell. It was a yellowish color and was odorless. I was very disappointed because this product is very hard to come by and I was excited to see it on Amazon. It's almost like someone poured the Argan oil and replaced it with something else.<br />Anyway, its going back.
I don't think there is a part of your body that wouldn't benefit from this oil. I use it on my hair, and mix a bit in my conditioner. Great for the skin and especially the face. I also use it for dried cuticles. Perfect size.
I was hoping more of this oil.<br />First it does not have any árgan type of scent... on the contrary it smells like fried oil. Not good. It is not super strong scent, but definitely you can smell it.<br />Second, it does not absorbe fast. I was oily until I fell asleep.<br />It was lightweight.<br />I did felt my skin hidrates the next day, but not quite sure if this is better than other oils that I use.<br />Definitely, I won’t use it, because mainly of the French fries smell.
I have dry skin and hair, so I'm always looking for new moisturizers. I love Argan oil and have had great results with it. This is a lovely oil. It's very light and absorbs quickly. I love using it on my legs. It has no color or real scent. On your body it's very nice and hydrates your skin without leaving you greasy.<br /><br />I also had great results using it on my hair and a little goes a long way. I especially like it on my ends. It's wonderful to soften and repair damaged hair.<br /><br />Very nice oil, would recommend. Great for anyone with dry skin who likes oils.

The item description is Argan Magic 100% Pure Argan Oil – Moisturizing Oil that Infuses Skin with Enriched Hydration | Leaves Skin Restored & Refreshed | Non-Greasy | Rich in Vitamin E | Made in USA | Cruelty Free (2 oz). What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: believe it or not, i love this. i know most of the reviews are complaining about the smell. if you are a purist and are sensitive to fragrances, you will love this. i have allergic rhinitis that gets triggered by scented stuff and my husband gets a headache and it is so hard to find unscented/fragrance free hair products. glad i found this.<br /><br />my husband bought me argan oil without fragrance but it was super heavy, thick and sticky. this one is super lightweight. when first applied, my hair looks oily but it goes away, it just keeps my hair soft. i have very frizzy hair and dry -- not damaged, it's just the texture of my hair, and i love this.

Output: I use this for deep conditioning, hot oil treatments in my hair and it works marvelously!! I take about a half dollar size amount, heat it up slightly and apply throughout my hair before sitting with a processing cap. Definitely reduces frizz and strengthens the follicle! This Argan oil is just above around in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes.

Wonder4 Electric Callus Remover - Rechargeable Electric Foot File Callus Shaver Hard Skin Remover Pedicure Tools with 3 in 1 Roller Heads, for Cracked Heels Calluses and Dead Skin | I have the Amope, which only has one file. This has three, from coarse to fine. But the files are quite a bit narrower than the Amope. I thought this would be a bigger deal, but most of the time only part of the file is being used as I am working on the tough spots like the heel or edge of the toe. It doesn't have a lot of power and it kind of slows down a lot. But it gets the job done. I like that it is rechargeable as the Amore went through a lot of batteries.
PARWIN Infrared Flat Iron 1 1/4 Inch Digital Hair Straightener Iron with Ceramic Tourmaline Plate Temperature Control Hair Iron Christmas Gift Black | We have been using this for several months and it hasn't died yet. That shouldn't be a big deal, but there seems to be more and more stuff that doesn't last. It is easy to use and does a good job.
Water Flosser Cordless Teeth Cleaner, SOOCAS Professional Oral Irrigator 230ML Portable and Rechargeable Water Dental Flosser with 3 Modes and 4 Jet Tips, IPX7 Waterproof, USB Charged for 30 Days Use | I had never used one of these before, so I didn't realize how much of a mess they can make.<br /><br />First, I saw that the USB charger did not come with a plug. I have plenty, so it wasn't a problem, but it would have been if I hadn't.<br /><br />The plug that covers the USB port is not attached to the unit and I can see it very easily lost.<br /><br />There is no hose. The whole unit needs to be picked up and rotated to use this item. I found it a little cumbersome, especially when I couldn't figure out which button was the off one when I was using it.<br /><br />If you don't get the nozzle in just right it will come ...
Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum | Well, I do have a setting light. These polishes work fine. I think some of the premium ones, like OPI, work better, and are easier to see what colors are in the bottle. But, for the price they are OK. Gel polish is a pain to use.
Wahl Smart Shave Rechargeable lithium ion wet / dry water proof foil shaver for men. Smartshave technology for shaving, trimming, and wet or dry shave with precision ground trimmer blade #7061-900 | My husband is very happy with this razor. I think of Wahl as a hair clipper and probably wouldn't have thought of them when replacing his razor, but I am glad to have learned that they make just as good of a quality razor. He uses a regular razor in the shower, then runs an electric around to catch any missed spots. Because of this the battery doesn't need to be charged very often. The battery life indicator is very helpful as is the razor's ability to charge very quickly. He likes it. He is not raving about it being the best razor ever, but we are both happy with this unit.
Neutrogena Fragrance-Free Lightweight Body Oil for Dry Skin, Sheer Moisturizer in Light Sesame Formula, 8.5 fl. oz | The oil itself is great, but to me it smells like suntan oil. I use coconut oil, also scented but very lightly and it dissipates quickly, after a shower. Although I love Neutrogena stuff and use many of their products, I will stick to [[ASIN:B00P8CQK90 Fractionated Coconut Oil - 100% Pure Premium Grade - PUMP + SQUEEZE CAP + FREE Recipe eBook! - BIG 16Oz - Best Carrier Oil & Base For Essential Oils, Aromatherapy & Massage - Great for Roll-On Bottles - Soothing for Skin & Hair!]]

Only got this brush to see if it'll actually fluff this matted blanket and it did. It's a lot of work but it feels nice. Its was a struggle to push out the wires. When it finally popped out the culprit was a few bent wires that prevented it to fully come out. It works for what I need it to.
[[VIDEOID:5ee8a58a8f5b5d4ef7ef0f6e1c59ab85]] Es un excelente artículo, lo recomiendo para aquellos gatos o perros que son muy peludos. En mi casa tengo un gato muy peludo, así que este cepillo es ideal para remover el pelo, y a la vez a mi gato le gusta el masaje que le da. En lo personal me gusta porqué es un cepillo fácil de limpiar. Me gustó mucho.
With four cats and a large dog, I am always looking for good grooming tools. I liked the idea of this brush, but the actual product really wasn't all that. First of all, this thing is much larger than any other slicker style brush I have. This is a great feature for my large dog, but it was just ridiculous trying to groom my cats with this large, unyielding wire brush. So, not a good choice for the cats.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not a good choice for my dog either, as she has a short coat with little to no undercoat and she was really uncomfortable with wires dragging on her skin. She's more of a rubber curry comb type gal, I guess. Besides the size and wire ...
The brush works as well as any other wire brush but has the added benefit of retracting the bristles to clean itself and it also keeps the bristles from getting bent. Overall its a good product and for less than 20 dollars its definitely a compelling choice.
This brush is gentle on skin. It isnt the gentlest on long silky hair. The plastic feels a bit on the brittle and cheap side. The self cleaning mechanism works well. The tines are short and spaced close together and it tends to pull more on the topcoat than the undercoat. I'd say this brush is better suited to larger dogs with shorter hair like a shepherd rather than dogs like my spaniels.
This brush worked excellent on my shedding Golden retriever and the push button release is great.

Target: The lever to lift the brushes up and down is tough to push. I don't know if it will get better with time, but the dozen or so times I have used this has not helped. But it works well to brush my dog and I am finding pulling the fur off the bristles works just fine.

YISIBIA Nipple Covers For Women Disposable Self-Adhesive Satin Nipple Stickers Petals Breast Pasties 40 Pairs (light beige) | Review MOST DEFINITELY provided this review:<br /><br />I have used these type of nipple covers in the past and loved them. They come in really handy in the summer with items that are a challenge to wear even with a strapless bra. This pack comes with tons of the covers...some are pedal shaped and some are round, so will last multiple seasons. I tend to reuse mine until they lose their stickiness they don’t smell or anything.
Facial Cleansing Brush made with Ultra Hygienic Soft Silicone 4-PACK | These are so fun...I have one at my sink, one in the shower, one in my travel case and an extra. These fine little scrubbers are now replacing using an apricot scrub that is pretty harsh after using these. I highly recommend! The colors are cute too!
Travel Bottles for Toiletries, Silicone Travel Size Bottles And Squeezable Containers Holders with belt clip Keychain for Backpack, Shampoo, Liquid, Cosmetic Products(2 oz, 6 Pack) | These are a fun addition to my travel items when it’s safe to travel again. They all came individually wrapped, are squeezeable and a tight seal. Good overall quality.

Moyo Natural Labs 9 Piece 2 Oz Premium HDPE Travel Size bottle Reusable Travel Bottle Kit And Travel Jars With Fine Mist Spray Bottle BPA FREE travel accessories for women TSA Approved 2oz 59 ml | This is an excellent set of small travel bottles!<br /><br />They are well constructed, and so far have not leaked a drop. I am confident in using these with any liquids; the last thing you want is leakage, and I do not expect to have any with this set.<br /><br />You get nine vessels to hold liquids with the set: 1 spary bottle, 3 squeeze bottles, and 5 small twist cap bottles.<br /><br />For an inexpensive set, this one really covers all of the bases. Highly recommended!

I am surprised this product worked. It does what it claims to do. It gave me a realistic-looking tan and that tan withstood multiple showers and cleaning wipes. The tan looks like I spent the day in the sun, rather than dark brown or orange.<br /><br />The problem with a product like this is the color contrast with the places you do not apply this to, or if you miss a spot, or if you have thinning hair. It can go on blotchy if it is not applied evenly. Some parts of the body might become darker or not absorb this as well. Making it appear smooth is a challenge. Also, where do you stop applying this to your body? Wherever you stop there will be a ...
Pros: There is no smell. I have another sunless tanning product I love but it leaves myself and my sheets/clothes with a fragrance I am not the biggest fan of. This product however had no scent to it, which is great. The product is also quick drying. You can apply it and put your clothing back on fairly quickly after unlike many other sunless tanning products. Not orange! This is a big one. The color it produces actually makes you look tan and not like a grapefruit, as so many others do.<br /><br />Cons: The only downside to the product for me was that I found it to be on the blotchy side. After applying I had several spots that were excessively dark in color. I am ...
It works, haven't tried it on my face yet. Try to rub it in all the way or it can streak
Wholesome ingredients! Nice golden tan, goes on smooth and easy to apply!
I use primarily as a facial lotion and it works great, Not greasy or orange.

Target: Review by spouse:<br /><br />I really like this self tanner. I have been using jergens for years, but this seems to pack a better punch and works quickly and seems to be cumulative. I didn’t find it to be orangey, but was conscious to not put too much around my knees, elbows and ankles since these types of products tend to get a little darker in those areas and can kind of go orangey quickly.

short bob human hair wigs lace front human hair wigs straight bob wigs natural color | I am more of a thick hair girl so I was not amazed at this wig. I have a large head so the wig looks very thin on me. The construction is superb and the knots are bleached and the hairline plucked. perfect if you have a thin face. The length is fine
Sam&Helen Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit, 5Pairs Magnetic Eyelashes And 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliners With Eyelash Applicator-No Glue Needed | They ok, not the best lashes..... I like em full and long. these are church lashes (LOL) but they work, they stick to your eyes momentarily they last about 2 days whereas my usual lashes last for about 4-7 days. Says reusable but you will have to clean them well.

Hair is perfect for wig making. Hair is quality and does not tangle. One bundle by itself is thin once all bundle is blended together hair is thick and ready to be cut into a style. Hair can tolerate high heat. Hair is silky sexy.
Hair is so soft<br />Bundles are a little thin though<br />I will need to add in another bundle to get the fullness I like<br />Hair quality is great though
I LOVE MY NEW WIG! I used 3 bundles + closure not only that I dyed the hair too. It took bleach really well and the hair was still soft after using bleach on it. Will definitely buy again from this company they have the best hair on amazon!
[[VIDEOID:ac703f19ef4bc3ac2b0ebc3199308f2f]] i absolutely love this hair .. I’ll be purchasing again soon!
The hair is soft, manageable and the color is a dark 1B. I noticed there's minimal shedding even after washing the hair. They're true to length and the hair is thicker in the root and thinner towards the ends. In the last photo I dyed the hair black and washed it. I recommend purchasing this hair.
Really soft. A little thin but works very good for straight looks.
[[VIDEOID:c2e5a1ca1a75fceabb11204b06346775]] Honestly these are the longest bundles I’ve ever had lol as all wefted hair, longer hair lengths means thinner bundles and that’s kind of the case with these. Although they are on the thinner side they have a natural pattern that goes thickest from the wefted hair and thins out to the bottom giving you a more natural look when installed. The hair has plenty of movement and very soft to the touch. The luster is there as you can see when my light hits it. I’m also glad that the color isn’t super black and has natural black color with hints of brown. I know that it’s gonna but the below my back with these lengths so hopefully I don’t sit on it by mistake lol

Aleavia Restore Soothing Mist – Fragrance-Free Organic & All-Natural Prebiotic, Restorative Spray – Nourish your Healthy Skin Microbiome – 4 oz. | I get "outbreaks" on my hands sometimes. Usually when my hands get bad (even just one hand) I have to apply a cortisone rub a few times a day over a few days to make the redness, flakiness, and itchiness subside.<br /><br />I was hesitant to get this because the ingredients seem pretty simple for something that is supposed to make a difference in psoriasis. Well I am surprised at how effective this spray is. Instead of touching the cortisone rub at all - I just sprayed this on the backs of my hands.

YsesoAi 28 Pcs Hair Curlers Spiral Curls No Heat Wave Hair Curlers Styling Kit Spiral Hair Curlers Magic Hair Rollers with 2 Pieces Styling Hooks for Most Kinds of Hairstyles (20 cm/ 7.8 inches) | First off - how these arrive in the bag - like a little roll - is the way they will end up in your hair. There is no way to make them spiral at all. More like standard old school curls.<br /><br />I found them a bit hard to use as well - as I found it a big pain to get the stick through the curler. I ended up squashing like four of five on the stick at a time (since that was the truly painful part) and then using it on my hair one after the other. Plus even though I cut my hair to like shoulder length - these are actually pretty short - just for the ends of your hair really.<br /><br />With ...
YanJie Velvet Stretched Button Headband Holder for Nurse Mask Women/Girls/Men 6 Package, Leopard Black Gray Velvet ,Protect your Ear Headband 20inch (Leopard) | These headbands are completely necessary for me to live my life these days. I tried other masks extenders but nothing either stayed put, was comfortable, or actually helped with my mask. I have a few different types of mask headbands now - as I wear one every time I leave my house.<br /><br />These particular ones are pretty nice! If you have a problem with slicker material ones slipping out of your hair - THESE will stay put due to the velour grip on your head. They are not too tight either - some bands I tried squish your brain... The buttons are also the NICEST buttons I have seen on a mask headband like ever. The ONLY flaw with the pretty and matching buttons that are ...
Tropical Holistic Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Rose Hip Facial Oil, Anti-Aging Face Oil to Tighten Wrinkles & Lines, Restores Elasticity, Nourishing Hair Oil, 4 oz | I like this oil. With skin care I try to stay as natural as possible. As I have gotten older I also try to stay with pure oils as much as possible.<br /><br />Some people may think rosehip oil will smell like roses. It is not flowery - rather more earthy - more tea like, to me anyway. I like the smell. Kind of fresh and earthy. Not bad at all.<br /><br />This stuff goes on smoothly and easily and absorbs into my skin very nicely. I don't use it during the day under makeup or to work as I have my sunscreen moisturizer routine down pat there. But this is great for the evening or a weekend at home. A little goes a long way as ...

So I stocked up on both - but then the products crapped out on me. : (<br /><br />I was hesitant to try yet another deodorant as most end up sucking big time and end up in a wasteland... But I did - and I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID! This stuff is AMAZING! It works - it REALLY WORKS!!! And a little goes a long way.

Busy Co. Biodegradable Hydrating Hand Wipes, With Collagen and Peptides to Smooth and Improve Elasticity, 15 Individually Wrapped Wipes (Refresh Line - Fresh Citrus) | While these wipes are very nice plus good for the environment - they are probably not something you will use all the time - only because of their price. I think these are good for one off things - like toting with you when you go camping or hiking or traveling or something. Maybe to keep in the car - just in case (although heat will surely make them dry out).<br /><br />They are unscented - which I love. I hate things that are loaded with perfume. They work well to cleanse a particular area. You can't use them for like a full body thing while camping in deep woods as you would have to use a few to get the job done.<br /><br />Overall very nice ...

Seriously doubt these are Organic - no marking as such - but there is no info whatsoever anyway - so who knows what is truly in them.<br /><br />I put a ball in my glass mug and poured boiling water anyway. There is no "flowering" like you may get from flowering tea balls. It just sort of filled the entire mug with flowers - petals and flowers. Like the entire mug.

These have me conflicted on whether I like them or not. They are pretty (at least the darker solids, I threw the other ones away as I'll never use them) and they are a soft velvet and do have button for your mask loops to hook on to. That was the main reason I ordered these because I'm tired of my ears getting sore being in the medical field having to wear a mask for over 8 hours at a time. I do feel lole the velvet helps it stay in place more than the regular cotton or polyester ones but velvet is thick and makes me sweat. Not only that but the way the headband is designed there isnt much stitching to hold the buttons in ...
The width and quality of the Headband was amazing. I have alot of hair and extremely long. I felt this didn't work for me because it kept sliding off. It would not stay in place for me.
Like it, so comfortable. Highly recommend.
Soft and comfortable, but because the headband is a sewed fabric, it can be annoying trying to get the headband to line up, especially trying to make sure the buttons are exposed and not rolled to the back the headband
It’s really nice
Love these headbands!! So comfortable to wear and love that it has the buttons you can hook a mask on when needed !
Love these headbands. Soft and fit well. They even have buttons to attach your face masks to. They are great

The item description is Velvet Women Headband with Buttons,YANJIE 6 Pcs Hair Band Ear Protection Holder for Nurses Doctors Non Slip,Stretchy Leopard Head Bands Fashion Unisex Hair Accessories Head Wrap 20inch. What is the user's textual review of the item?

Target: I like these mask headbands.  First - the button placement is PERFECT!  Some headbands have the buttons way too high to use - these are set PERFECTLY.  I LOVE that  The colors are pretty nice too - especially for office wear! Not sure how often I will use the print ones - but the other colors are perfect for the office.  And when I am going out with my mask on - I never leave home without a mask headband.  It makes life so much easier and the mask more secure and much more comfortable.<br />The material is GREAT for making sure it does not slip off your head.  The velour makes sure it stays put and grips your hair and doesn't move.  The buttons are very pretty, stylish, and very much color coordinated with some of the headbands.  The only thing - because the buttons are 'so nice' and sort of concave - once you stick your mask on the button sort of sticks out a bit - more so than a flat button.  BUT with that being said - it grips your mask securely.  Some flat buttons let the mask slip off sort of easily.  AND it is just a button so who cares if it does not lie perfectly flat against your head. I mean I am already wearing a mask - so how picky can I really be.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the "Helpful" button.  Thanks! : )

3 Pieces Messy Donut Chignons Hair Piece Scrunchies Synthetic Extensions Updo Hair Bun for Women Scrunchies Natural Black #1b | My hair is a 3/4 medium to dark brown with some red undertones. I went with the 1b natural black because the 4 was described as light brown. Light brown is usually a 5. I suggest you go with the number instead of relying on the description. This is still a good product and will match my hair when I first color it... it is always a bit darker. Unfortunately, I was not blessed with thick luscious hair so my buns are super thin (see pictures). This scrunchie is made of synthetic hair and easy to use. I only need to use one but it came with three buns. This is an added bonus because over time synthetic hair will become frizzy and tangled. Also with synthetic, ...
Red Carpet Manicure Starter Kits | I know gel polish has been around for quite some time but I actually switched from dip powder to gel. I do my own nails and just find dip to be messy and time consuming. I figured at this point all gel systems were the same, so I’ve been using a cheap brand. I came across this kit and definitely notice the difference in Red Carpet. It’s much better quality. Your gel polish will last 21 days if you follow the directions. Five stars from me and it’s a great value!

This product works so well. Leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy.
I need a leave in conditioner after washing my hair and this product didn't detangled my hair. I will be returning it.
I really like products from L'ange. This leave in conditioner is no different. It is not cheap at $22 since the bottle is fairly small but the product in it is very good and you don't need a whole lot of it so that does make up for it.<br /><br />This leave in detantler comes in a nice mister bottle. The mister on it is actually very nice and pretty fine allowing you to distribute the product very nicely onto your hair, and therefore you don't need that much of it. It smells absolutely fantastic and does exactly what it promises. I have absolutely not tangles in my hair when I use this.<br /><br />My hair is nice and soft and looks just great. This is a ...
Excellent product!
This product has a nice, clean smell. It left my hair feeling thick with increased volume. I did find that it dried my hair out more than other products I’ve used.
I love Lange hair products, especially the violet ones for keeping hair bright and blonde, like the conditioning mask that I use in the shower. I was hoping that this leave in would be a little creamier like that and leave my hair more moisture and easier to brush when wet, but it didn't really work for me.
I have the worst tangled hair ever from all the highlights and dying it I've done over the last 15 years. My hair is so damaged. And also because it is so long, it's almost impossible to manager. I also have a TON of hair. When I go to the salon, they usually have two people blow drying my hair. Anyhow, I have a detanger brush, I've bought hair mask, I've used leave in conditioner, and I've used different detanglers. (I've done the it's the 10 product also). I have to say I was very impressed with this bottle. Right off when I sprayed it, I noticed it came out different. It wasn't a spray, it was more of a mist spray so it sprayed more powerfully ...

I'm trying to grow it out about four more inches. My ends tend to get thin from breakage. I'm hoping this product helps prevent this. So far I notice my hair is breaking less when I brush it. It's a great detangler with a clean scent. It adds shine to my hair and there is less frizz.

Output: This product has a nice, clean smell. It left my hair feeling thick with increased volume. I did find that it dried my hair out more than other products I’ve used. I love Lange hair products, especially the violet ones for keeping hair bright and blonde, like the conditioning mask that I use in the shower. I was hoping that this leave in would be a little creamier like that and leave my hair more moisture and easier to brush when wet, but it didn't really work for me. I have the worst tangled hair ever from all the highlights and dying it I've done

I think these are cute little edgy nail decals to add on to any nails. I’d add them to long nails though not short because they are not tiny they are a nice size. I really like them!
